
Hopefully, we've finally put winter behind us!  Even if it makes another appearance, I've brought spring into the <object value = “house” id=”0” type=”perm”> house</object> anyway! Spring has always been my favorite season, even as a child.  I couldn't wait for green grass, birds chirping, baby animals, and sunshine after a long, harsh winter on the farm[a].  Maybe that's why I tend to decorate with spring-like home decor[b] all year round?


If you're looking to add a feeling of spring to your home, it's easy to do without having to redecorate your entire house.  I haven't been up to decorating much here in the <object value = “house” id=”0” type=”perm”> rental</object>, but just swapping out some simple seasonal updates can make a big difference. 


As I shared previously, the <object value = “living room” id=”1” type=”perm”> living room </object> has a wall of built-ins [c]which is great for holding collections[d], etc and although I wish both sides were symmetrical (maybe that's the accountant in me), they are perfect for adding seasonal items like nests, etc...


Years ago, my oldest daughter started bringing me <object value =”nest” id = “2” type=”perm”>nests</object>[e] that she'd find and now my middle daughter has taken up the torch.  I've lost count how many I have now!  I've noticed that all my daughters seem to love to collect bits of moss, pretty rocks, [f]and <object value =”nest” id = “2” type=”perm”>nests</object> when they are playing outside. 


Things like nests, potted plants, birds, cut flowers, and spring-inspired items tucked into built-ins and bookcases is one of the easiest ways to decorate for spring...[g]


Another favorite way that I like to change things out for the seasons is to fill a <object value=”dough bowl“  id = “3” type=”perm”>dough bowl</object> or an <object value=”basket” id =”4” type=”perm”>oversize basket</object> with some of my favorite things[h] that reflect the time of year.  This tray-basket[i] from Pottery Barn is perfect for the top of a coffee table[j] to fill with candles and ornaments for Christmas and now spring plants, nests, and glass floats [k]for spring...


I love having <object value = “live plants” id = “5” type=”perm”>live plants</object>[l] in the <object value=”house” id = “0” type=”perm”>house</object> and inexpensive daffodils and spring bulbs are a great way to add greenery as they last longer than cut flowers...[m]


... but sometimes a bundle of tulips[n] has to come <object value=”house” id = “0” type=”perm”>home</object> with me.  Nothing says spring like tulips!


Swapping out pillows, throw blankets, and even window treatments once the weather starts getting warmer and bringing in fresh spring colors and patterns is also a great way to update your home for the spring season...[o]


We are excited to reach up in the 70's this week after a nasty sleet/ice storm late last week that knocked out power[p] for most of the area, so at least the spring touches inside the <object value=”house” id = “0” type=”perm”> house </object> will match the outside! Yes, the weather gives you whiplash here in NC with the constant changing...  


I'm happy to be part of one of my favorite group of bloggers sharing spring inspiration around our <object value=”house” id = “0” type=”perm”>homes</object>[q]...


Make sure that you check out all the beautiful ideas and inspiration today...




[a]Should not be annotated, as it is not a possession of the author at the current time.
[b]Should not be annotated, as it is not clear what the possessed object actually is.
[c]Should not be annotated, as it is part of the living room.
[d]Should not be annotated because it is a generic reference, and no actual possession can be inferred.
[e]Despite the fact that the action occurs in the past, she mentions later in the blog that she has lost count of how many nests has. Therefore, we have to go back and mark the possession.
[f]Moss and pretty rocks should not be marked because it is not clear from the context if the children are bringing these inside. However, for the nests, we know that this is the case.
[g]Generic considerations. It is not clear if that is what the author is doing herself.
[h]Too generic; does not refer to an identifiable possession.
[i]It is unclear if the author actually owns that tray, or she is giving it as an example to the readers. I would not annotate it.
[j]Not clear if the author owns a coffee table, as this sounds more like a consideration/opinion of what could be used with the tray-basket.
[k]Not clear if these are the author's possessions.
[l]Seems to carry a stronger implication that the author has live plants, as she refers back to her house.
[m]Generic considerations, that don't imply possession strongly.
[n]Not a mention of a current possession.
[o]Generic considerations. It is not clear if the author is actually doing that herself.
[p]Not a concrete item.
[q]Author is a co-owner.
