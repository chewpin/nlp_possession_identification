travel
is
to
take
a
journey
into
yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x93
is
my
sixth
life
is
it
seventh
we
move
to
a
new
city
especially
if
it\xe2\x80\x99s
abroad
it
often
feels
like
we
started
living
a
completely
new
life
we
are
a
different
person
compared
to
the
one
that
left
home
home
.\r\n
in
a
foreign
place
feels
much
different
than
going
there
as
a
tourist
a
tourist
it
seems
much
harder
to
experience
the
way
the
foreign
culture
breaths
and
it\xe2\x80\x99s
much
harder
to
find
the
nooks
and
crannies
which
locals
are
well
aware
of
immersing
myself
in
another
culture
was
a
worthwhile
mind
expanding
experience.\r\n
asked
myself
why
that
is
what
happens
when
we
move
to
a
new
city
\r\n
get
shocked
out
of
our
minds.\r\n
could
not
have
imagined
a
scene
like
this
in
my
wildest
dreams
even
though
we\xe2\x80\x99ve
all
heard
stories
of
how
liberal
people
are
imagine
a
coffee
shop
in
which
one
could
enjoy
cannabis
is
placed
in
the
heart
of
city
right
next
to
a
church
which
is
sitting
comfortably
next
to
famous
red
light
district
filled
with
ladies
of
the
night
seductively
trying
to
beckon
you
over
all
the
while
kids
are
walking
about
the
premises
minding
their
own
business.\r\n
something
so
far
out
of
what
my
surroundings
taught
me
right
has
shocked
me
and
made
me
smile
at
the
same
time
helped
me
grow
because
realized
that
nothing
is
inherently
good
or
bad
it\xe2\x80\x99s
only
our
perceptions
that
make
it
so.\r\n
mind
was
also
blown
during
the
first
few
encounters
with
traffic
which
made
me
feel
like
was
the
frog
from
the
classic
arcade
game.\r\n
shocked
out
of
our
minds
is
eye
opening
for
a
few
reasons
\r\n
'1
live
in
the
moment
much
more
often
without
even
trying
am
shocked
have
no
time
to
think
experiences
tend
to
do
that
to
all
of
us
\r\n
'2
learn
about
ourselves
by
finding
new
personal
limits
we
might
have
never
thought
were
there
then
we
break
them
and
our
comfort
zone
expands
never
thought
might
be
uncomfortable
to
see
children
near
prostitutes
but
it
did
stick
out
in
my
mind.\r\n
'3
experiences
like
these
we
get
to
see
the
world
with
a
new
refined
set
of
eyes
this
is
excellent
because
as
put
it
\xe2\x80\x9cwhen
you
change
the
way
you
look
at
things
the
things
you
look
at
change\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n
'4
the
things
we
fear
increases
confidence
as
suggested
by
great
way
to
ground
ourselves
during
these
changes
in
the
way
we
view
life
is
to
meditate
least
it
helped
me
tremendously.\r\n
'
get
to
reinvent
ourselves.\r\n
'
moved
to
which
my
first
city
away
from
home
home
it
felt
like
could
finally
get
rid
of
the
expectations
everyone
in
my
environment
had
of
me.\r\n
'
biggest
obstacle
to
change
are
often
the
people
closest
to
us
as
we
are
afraid
of
disappointing
them
much
easier
not
to
bother
with
what
people
will
think
now
but
back
then
it
felt
terrifyingly
uncomfortable
to
do
something
my
parents
or
my
friends
did
not
expect
of
me.\r\n
'
a
new
city
we
almost
get
to
start
our
lives
over
makes
replacing
old
habits
with
new
ones
seem
easy
fact
we
have
to
make
new
habits
as
everything
is
new
for
us.\r\n
best
habit
picked
up
after
my
move
to
is
to
walk
for
at
least
two
hours
a
day
and
haven\xe2\x80\x99t
dropped
it
since
allows
me
to
get
to
know
the
city
am
in
much
better
it\xe2\x80\x99s
a
good
exercise
and
it\xe2\x80\x99s
also
a
form
of
a
meditative
practice.\r\n
changes
that
happen
within
us
once
we
move
cities
can
be
so
powerful
that
often
remember
the
past
not
by
year
but
by
place
lived
in
at
that
moment
in
time
feels
like
led
completely
different
lives
\xe2\x80\x93
just
hope
that
have
more
lives
than
cats
do
because
close
to
nine
\r\n
learn
that
people
everywhere
are
people
just
like
us.\r\n
man
that
worked
in
a
guest
house
kind
of
like
a
hostel
these
are
common
in
was
in
during
my
stay
in
came
from
in
search
of
a
better
life.\r\n
had
12
hour
night
shifts
working
six
days
a
week
work
visa
alone
costs
his
monthly
salary
every
year
about
eight
years
he\xe2\x80\x99s
worked
at
the
hostel
he
got
to
go
home
to
where
he
could
see
his
children
only
twice
now
his
wife
is
also
working
in
but
he
told
me
they
only
get
to
see
each
other
for
a
little
bit
every
few
days
at
his
workplace.\r\n
'
knew
his
situation
was
less
than
ideal
but
instead
of
letting
it
all
get
him
down
he
spoke
with
great
vigor
of
his
plans
to
open
up
a
business
back
in
'
realized
we
had
much
more
in
common
than
it
seemed
at
first
glance
hopes
and
dreams
are
not
much
different
than
mine
nor
is
his
struggle
to
materialize
them
he
had
a
much
more
difficult
starting
position
in
this
life
than
did
to
be
honest
wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
be
too
keen
to
trade
places
with
him.\r\n
find
happiness
in
unexpected
places.\r\n
out
a
fruit
pomelo
it\xe2\x80\x99s
a
fruit
that
resembles
an
orange
and
a
mildly
sour
grapefruit
was
extremely
joyful
for
me
is
quite
an
ordinary
fruit
in
but
had
no
idea
it
even
existed
before
came
here.\r\n
usually
travel
just
with
my
backpack
backpack
consists
of
clothes
clothes
and
my
laptop
laptop
from
which
do
my
work
from
a
desk
desk
to
put
a
laptop
laptop
on
and
stable
the
only
other
things
find
necessary
for
a
life
that
makes
me
happy
is
a
bed
warm
bed
to
have
a
restful
night
in
and
a
shower
shower
moving
often
realized
that
we
really
don\xe2\x80\x99t
need
more
\xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d
in
order
to
have
a
fulfilled
life.\r\n
reason
would
recommend
everyone
go
and
live
in
a
different
place
at
least
once
in
their
life
and
preferably
abroad
is
because
by
doing
so
learned
that
no
one
is
much
different
from
us
learned
that
every
way
of
living
life
is
ok
and
breeds
just
as
many
happy
and
many
unhappy
people
as
does
life
back
home
and
expand
my
consciousness
drastically
my
mind
nothing
beats
that.\r\n
what
way
has
travel
helped
you
grow
you
have
any
positively
shocking
experiences
from
your
trips
home
or
abroad

we
first
moved
into
our
house
house
our
backyard
backyard
was
a
house
typical
new
construction
home
on
barren

no
plants
no

that
was
it
living
in
old
homes
old
homes
with
established
landscaping
to
work
with
our
backyard
sad
little
backyard
was
a
bit
depressing
love
to
design
small
garden
areas
but
since
our
soil
soil
was
filled
with
rocks
planting
was
nearly
impossible
time
had
the
urge
to
plant
something
it
was
a
big
ordeal
knew
was
going
to
have
to
enjoy
the
small
improvements
we
could
make
each
year
since
a
professionally
landscaped
backyard
was
not
in
our
plans.\r\n

backyard

didn\xe2\x80\x99t
have
any
structure
at
all
to
begin
with
so
last

we
focused
on
adding

and
function
by
creating
a
patio

for
our
fire
pit

dividing
our
backyard

into
four
zones
we
felt
like
we
could
make
the
most
of
our
space
and
even
almost
visualize
it
eventually
being
a
charming
and
useful
backyard

also
help
us
to
know
where
to
focus
our
time

making

zero
in
on
these

areas
can
improve
right

easy
for
me
to
get
overwhelmed
by
the

so
it\xe2\x80\x99s
nice
and
definitely
encouraging

there

is
what
can
quickly
transform

uneventful
areas
into
inspiring

really
have
been
trying
hard

grow
in

stick
with
improving
one
corner
at

it

'\r\n
life
breathlessly\r\n
is
not
measured
by
the
number
of
breaths
we
take

by
the
moments
that
take

breath
away\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n

'infection
relief\r\n
've
been
complaining
about
shortness
of
breath
in
my
last
few
blog
posts
when
walking
or
climbing
stairs
more
than
'm
used
to
or
expect
with
40
%
-ish
lung
function
yesterday
morning
when
was
out
of
breath
after
just
walking
from
my
car
car
to
desk
desk
at
work
and
after
feeling
sooooo
tired
lately
decided
to
go
to
the
even
though
he
can\'t
treat
my
chronic
rejection
any
more
than
it\
's
already
being
treated
and
even
though
was
there
just
over
2
weeks
ago.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
bloods
done
x-ray
lung
function
was
n't
down
by
as
much
as
expected
given
how
crap
felt
was
38
%
%
6
min
walk
test
sats
were
about
94
%
when
started
with
a
heart-rate
of
133
which
is
high
even
for
me
6
mins
of
relatively
fast
walking
it
was
83
%
and
159
)
felt
like
it
should
have
been
worse
judging
by
how
felt.\r\n
'\r\n
'
the
bloods
showed
elevated
white
cell
count
and
ie
infection
and
felt
sssoooo
relieved
more
relived
when
had
a
temp
of
38.7
degrees
and
said
my
chest
sounds
crap
even
though
'm
not
coughing
at
all
means
it
's
actually
something
that
can
be
and
not
just
my
lungs
suddenly
deciding
to
decline
way
faster
just
before
our
trip
just
to
piss
me
off
have
picked
up
something
at
work
where
people
have
been
sick
and
it
sounds
like
a
hospital
waiting
room
with
all
the
sneezing
and
coughing
but
who
cares
right
dictates
that
you
go
to
work
not
matter
how
sick
has
also
been
sick
(
thanks
to
someone
at
work
who
sits
across
from
him
and
came
in
on
sick
)
is
why
some
post
transplant
patients
work
at
all
but
wanted
a
normal
life
which
comes
with
this
risk
so
it
's
just
something
have
to
deal
with.\r\n

having
lunch
at

house
tomorrow
looking

it
mom
was
26
when
she
had
me
and
29
when
she
had
my

to
think
that
when
she
was
my
age
she
had
to
cope
with
a
2-year
old
and
a
5-year
old
with
a
chronic
disease
and
bad
prognosis
at
the
time
is
probably
the
strongest
woman
know
and
the
best
role-model
a

can
have
up
she
was
the
perfect
mix
if
caring

scary
and
guess
that\

what
you
need
to
be
when

not

absolutely

trying
to
load
a
new
photo
photo
and
it
keeps
on
turning
up
as
a
brown
square
've
uploaded
it
3
times
now

give
up
it
when

was
very
nice
better
than
expected
to
church
in
the
morning
with
my
parents
and
grandfather
to
my
old
church
don\'t
go
there
anymore
but
my
parents
still
do
been
there
since
2005
except
for
a
wedding
and
a
funeral
in
between
was
quite
a
weird
experience
with
my
disabled
arm
and
portable
portable
but
'm
glad
went
that
a
whole
bunch
of
family
came
over
sister
2
cousins
and
watched
dvd
on

not
really
a
christmas
movie
but
ok
suppose
came
all
the
eating

just
spent
lounging
around

eating
building

and
playing

much
happening
don\'t
have
much
to

was
the
night
before
\n
is
forward
to
it
although
wish
could
have
the
same
level
of
excitement
that
did
when
was
little
guess
it\
's
just
part
of
growing
up
but
just
seemed
that
much
nicer
then
year
it\
's
a
bit
sad
that
can\'t
breathe
properly
although
a
lot
better
than
2
weeks
ago
and
don\'t
have
anyone
special
to
share
the
day
with
or
watch
with
(
my
favourite
xmas
movie
but
you
have
to
watch
it
with
someone
special
but
do
have
things
to
be
thankfull
for
having
the
most
amazing
mom
and
dad
and
sister
ever
even
though
they
sometimes
drive
me
mad
and
some
good
friends
etc
feel
positive
that
by
next
year
will
have
my
new
lungs
and
having
an
awesome
christmas
would
be
so
great
\n
'
'\n
'
last
2
days
have
been
very
nice
watching
movies
movies
eating
hanging
out
with
my
family
etc
like
we\
're
going
to
have
a
rainy
tomorrow
love
rainy
weather
it\
's
not
something
we
get
very
often
\n
'
'\n
'
'm
doing
good
almost
mucus
it\
's
soooooo
nice
thing
i
hate
most
about
having
this
picc
line
picc
line
in
my
arm
though
is
not
being
able
to
do
anything
to
my
hair
left
hand
can\'t
reach
my
head
can\'t
wash
brush
or
even
tie
up
my
hair
hate
not
being
in
control
of
how
my
hair
looks
's
frustrating
for
all
of
us
when
my
mom
or
sister
try
to
do
my
hair
because
handling
curly
hair
is
hard
enough
when
trying
to
do
so
by
yourself
least
it\
's
washed
and
as
ready
for
now
as
it\
's
ever
going
to
be
\n
'
'\n
'
everyone
has
an
awesome
amazing
tomorrow
filled
with
love
and
remember
the
real
reason
we
celebrate
it..
it
indirectly
marks
the
beginning
of
our
eternal
life
much
better
than
just
a
lung
transplant

night
or
early
this
morning
to
be
exact
)
a
year
ago
was
rushed
to
hospital
in
an
ambulance
at
about
02:30
because
was
finding
it
so
hard
to
breathe
was
the
closest
had
ever
come
to
dieing
at
least
that
's
how
it
felt
anyway
they
loaded
me
in
the
ambulance
my
sats
were
36
%
paramedic
thought
the
machine
was
broken
if
were
able
to
speak
at
that
moment
would
've
politely
pointed
out
that
the
machine
was
in
fact
working
and
that
could
definitely
feel
the
64
%
oxygen
that
was
missing
from
my
body
in
the
end
survived
after
some
's
etc
just
lost
some
serious
weight.\n
'\n
'
even
though
'm
on
's
again
for
xmas
at
least
feel
a
whole
lot
better

arrived

believe
it\
's
been
a

a
crap

for
me
emotionally
due
to
various
reasons
but
luckily
'm
feeling
better
today
all
dressed
up
and
washed
my
hair
well
my
mom
did
actually
it\

impossible
with
just
one
usefull

we
had
to
take
a
photo

of
me
and
my
sister
to
be
used
in
some
gifts
(

years
older

her
)
're
also
going
out
for
coffee

probably
be
wearing
something
with
sleeves
to
hide
the
picc

is
not
cool

the
weather
is
hot

an
update
\n
was
very
nice
saw
4
of
my
very
good
friends
during
the
day
which
resulted
in
me
being
pretty
tired
last
night
but
feeling
nice
and
social
for
a
change
of
them
have
gone
off
on
holiday
now
so
had
to
squeeze
them
in
glad
did
\n
'
'\n
'
feeling
a
lot
better
it\
's
sooo
great
to
sleep
well
and
breathe
so
much
easier
coughing
a
lot
less
and
easier
as
well
've
got
an
appointment
with
my
doctor
today
so
then
i\
'll
know
how
long
'll
be
on
the
antibiotics
mind
if
it\
's
quite
a
while
can
get
used
to
the
not-coughing
and
easier
breathing
obviously
me
and
my
new
lungs
will
be
a
match
made
in
heaven

seeing
another
friend
today
before
she
flies
home
and
'll
spend
some
time
with
my
sister
as
well
's
been
so
busy
so
far
this
holiday
haven\'t

much
of

i
feel
totally
out

with
the
shopping
thing
'm
not
doing
any
shopping
and
haven\'t
been
to
the
shops
in
ages
been
feeling
too
crap
and
shops
are
busy
'll
do
a
bit
of
shopping
after
the
rush
whereas
normally
this
time
of
year
it\
's
always
shopping
and
going
to
the
beach
haven\'t
been
to
the
beach
either
but
the
weather

beach
with
my
portable
oxyginator

weekend\n
'
weekend
was
quiet
relaxed
and
a
bit
of
a
blur
a
lot
better
thankfully
gratefull
to
be
coughing
less
and
breathing
easier
still
comes
and
goes
a
bit
but
managed
to
get
a
lot
of
rest
in.\n
'
'\n
'
three
friends
this
weekend
each
one
very
unique
them
got
me
thinking
quite
a
bit
though
is
interesting
to
observe
the
effect
that
my
whole
situation
has
had
on
my
friendships
that
is
an
understatement
of
the
reactions
have
upset
me
quite
a
bit
and
'm
sure
'll
be
getting
more
suprises
in
the
future
'll
have
to
learn
how
to
handle
them.\n
'\n
worst
is
having
to
go
from
being
close
to
someone
to
the
other
person
just
not
really
giving
a
damn
getting
too
caught
up
in
their
wildly
exciting
life
to
spare
a
few
moments
to
send
an
e-mail
e-mail
or
text
message
nevermind
making
a
phonecall
even
if
they
know
you\
're
\'sick\
(
they\
're
most
probably
not
reading
this
so
don\'t
start
stressing
thinking
it
may
be
you
!
-however
if
you
really
think
it
might
be
you
just
ask
me
you
get
the
people
who
you
were
always
friends
with
but
not
close
friends
who\
've
been
great
and
shown
care
and
support
all
the
way
making
the
friendship
so
much
tighter
up
is
the
weird
group
although
generally
don\'t
deal
with
them
myself
it\
's
usually
my
friends
or
mom
who
have
to
face
them
're
the
people
who
fake
an
interest
because
it\
's
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
don\'t
care
how
'm
doing
or
what
exactly\
's
wrong
with
me
but
they
ask
anyway
then
finally
there\
's
the
group
who\
's
always
been
your
best
friends
who\
're
still
there
for
you
all
the
way
and
who
have
to
put
up
with
your
moods
and
frustration
and
anger
caused
by
all
the
groups
of
people
just
listed
you
guys
want
to
say
thank
you
sometimes
act
like
a
bitch
it\
's
not
you
'm
angry
with
it\
's
the
situation
and
all
the
people
supporting
me
rest
assured
when
get
those
lungs
and
show
my
friends
the
time
of
their
lives
you
will
have
to
pay
for
yourself
though
didn\'t
win
the
lottery
)
they
won\'t
be
included
\n
'
'\n
'
to
conclude..
cf
and
especially
transplant
is
the
ultimate
friend-o-meter
love-o-meter
but
that
's
a
story
for
a
different
day
)
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
's
a
good
thing
wants
to
waste
time
and
energy
on
fake
friends

feel
a
better
day
coming
on
\n
the
picc
line
picc
line
insertion
was
so
much
better
than
expected
less
painless
than
the
normal
drip
needle
obviously
the
patch-
numbs
the
area-
played
a
role
)
and
my
doc
said
it
went
in
\'beautifully\
my
favourite
nurse
was
there
\n
'
'\n
'
's
still
early
in
the
day
but
definitelly
breathing
easier
already
forward
to
my
body
getting
a
bit
of
a
break
after
all
the
coughing
and
trying-to-breathe
it\
's
been
through
the
last
week
to
pick
up
a
kilo
or
so
as
well
amazing
thing
that
happened
that
'm
thankfull
for
is
that
on
the
way
to
the
hospital
my
dad
final
phoned
saying
that
the
final
sputum
results
were
back
and
my
evil
friend
me
explain
for
those
who
don\'t
have
cf
is
a
very
\'promiscious
bug\
yes
those
are
a
doctor\
's
exact
words
that
quickly
becomes
resistant
to
any
antibiotics
introduced
the
thing
that
my
is
sensitive
to
(
meaning
the
only
drug
that
works
is
drug
which
nebulise
by
some
kind
of
miracle
according
to
me
one
of
the
drugs
haven\'t
used
in
the
past

is
going

work
again
\n

my

great
to

around

'
day
\n
'
would
've
made
the
title
'bad
day
'
but
something
that
is
potentially
life-changing
also
seems
to
have
happened
today
so
it
's
not
all
bad.\n
'\n
'
'm
feeling
horrible
right
now
all
weak
and
trembling
and
feverish
and
tight
chested
a
good
combination
sent
in
some
sputum
fancy
term
for
mucus
pretty
gross
but
you\
'll
get
over
it
on
my
doc
today
and
the
results
aren\'t
back
yet
but
feeling
the
way
do
and
not
wanting
to
feel
like
this
for
much
longer
told
him
that
want
to
go
on
antibiotics
a
drip
in
other
words
my
mom
and
are
off
to
the
at
's
this
afternoon
don\'t
know
what
to
expect
though
as
previously
my
doc
and
talked
about
getting
a
line
the
next
time
have
to
go
on
've
never
had
one
of
those
and
it
sounds
scary
and
can
be
quite
a
wuss
when
it
comes
to
these
type
of
things
(
transplant\
's
ideal
for
me
then
will
do
an
update
on
how
it
went..
hope
my
favourite
nurse
is
there
\n
'
'\n
'
life-changing
thing
really
can\'t
say
anything
at
the
moment
as
it\
's
just
a
thought/idea
can
say
is
that
last
night
when
did
some
half-decent
praying
for
the
first
time
in
quite
a
while
told
that
the
two
things
'm
really
scared
of
at
the
moment
is
not
getting
to
in
time
when
get
the
call
for
lungs
's
a
1hr
40min
flight
on
a
commercial
airline
and
2.5hrs
on
charter
plane
've
basically
got
2-4hrs
to
get
there
it
will
be
tight
can\'t
stay
in
as
the
altitude
makes
it
10
times
harder
for
me
to
breathe
will
need
very
high
support
obviously
my
social
and
medical
support
system
is
here
and
the
other
thing
is
not
getting
lungs
in
time
or
having
an
infection
or
something
when
do
get
the
call
which
means
they
probably
won\'t
do
it
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they\
've
only
done
about
3
lung
transplants
this
year
scares
me
this
morning
got
a
phonecall
from
a
family
friend
with
the
most
unexpected
story
about
a
man
who
had
2
lung
transplants
who
she
met
via
her
sister
by
coincedence
phoned
the
guy
and
talked
to
him
and
it
was
felt
like
might
have
been
answering
my
prayer
right
there
keep
you
updated
if
this
should
lead
to
anything
\n
'
'\n
'
on
the
topic
of
prayer..
of
my
new
transplant
friends
she
had
hers
in
and
said
last
night
how
much
our
faith
has
helped
us
through
all
of
this
and
it
's
so
true
the
most
amazing
part
is
that
should
the
operation
not
happen
in
time
or
the
new
lungs
are
rejected
then
we
've
got
to
look
forward
to
anyway
it
's
really
a
win-win
situation
for
us
if
you
do
n't
believe
in
you
have
nothing
you
have
is
luck
and
you
have
to
put
all
your
faith
in
people
while
there
are
brilliant
people
out
there
they
make
mistakes
and
in
the
end
they
're
just
like
you
with
no
real
power
whatsoever.\n
'\n
'
will
leave
you
now
to
go
and
cough
some
more
and
try
to
get
myself
ready
for
this
afternoon..\n

'm
not
sure
if
anyone
except
maybe
some
friends
and
family
because
'll
kindly
force
them
to
do
so
)
is
going
to
read
this
blog
blog
but
was
inspired
so
much
by
reading
another
girl\
's
blog
blog
who
went
through
this
and
much
much
more
that
decided
to
try
it
out
for
myself
\n
from
the
obvious
therapeutic
properties
all
of
this
will
have
it
will
also
be
a
great
tool
for
me
as
everyone
always
wants
to
know
how
'm
doing
they
can
read
how
'm
doing
anytime
they
want
to
those
people
who
are
afraid
to
ask
me
and
end
up
asking
my
friends
\n
now
'm
ok-ish
a
difficult
morning
started
out
fine
did
my
first
nebuliser
neb
inhaling
medication
medication
using
nebuliser
small
machine
called
a
nebuliser
nebuliser
had
breakfast
breakfast
and
did
my
normal
morning
e-mail/facebook
check
then
proceded
upstairs
again
for
remaining
nebuliser
nebs
and
lying
on
physio-mat
==
don\'t
know
the
technical
term
for
this
device
it\
's
almost
like
a
back-massager
that
you
lie
on
which
pounds
out
mucus
belongs
to
my
physiotherapist
coughing
my
lungs
out
etc
realised
that
'm
running
a
fever
back
into
bed
bed
've
only
got
an
hour
before
need
to
be
at
physio
go
3
times
a
week
she
\'beats\'/pounds
my
chest
to
get
more
junk
out
)
that
don\'t
have
the
energy
to
go
and
asked
her
if
could
postpone
it
or
something
're
so
amazing
both
of
them
that
ended
up
receiving
a
home
visit
(
also
received
a
home
visit
from
some
dude
from
from
the
municipality
who
wanted
to
read
the
metres
think
he
got
the
shock
of
his
life
when
opened
the
door
in
my
pjs
with
my
restraining
me
like
a
dog
tied
to
a
tree
or
something
and
acting
like
nothing
is
wrong
)
\n
my
day
got
better
after
that
had
a
peacefull
afternoon
and
my
mom
and
just
got
back
from
having
some
drive-thru
cappuchino
at
the
beach
parking
lot
\n
think
this
is
enough
for
today
\n
'm
not
very
technologically
advanced..
and
still
figuring
out
how
everything
here
works
so
bear
with
me

'\n
for
the
it
5/13
we
kept
stuff
in
so
today
let
's
clear
stuff
out
is
in
your
diabetic
closet
that
needs
to
be
cleaned
out
can
be
an
actual
physical
belonging
or
it
can
be
something
you
're
mentally
or
emotionally
hanging
on
to
are
you
keeping
it
and
why
do
you
need
to
get
rid
of
it
(
you
of
for
this
topic
suggestion
)
\n
'\n
'
know
over
the
years
have
been
listed
as
uncompliant
in
my
medical
medical
files
saddest
part
is
that
was
trying
know
now
even
with
the
best
have
ever
had
know
my
previous
listed
me
as
uncompliant
though
worked
really
hard
on
reviewing
my
number
and
making
changes
as
necessary
know
my
current
family
practice
lists
me
as
uncompliant
because
of
the
fact
have
complications
and
even
thought
my
is
excellent
work
very
hard
to
keep
lows
at
bay
and
keep
my
under
control
in
fact
only
see
the
twice
a
year
because
it
is
considered
stable
currently.\n
'
'\n
'
know
it
infuriates
me
that
they
make
assumptions
the
minute
you
mention
complications
which
to
some
's
means
don\'t
try
don\'t
test
and
don\'t
care
but
find
it
insulting
that
they
write
me
off
tend
to
not
give
patients
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
know
that
so
many
people
including
nurses
feel
that
they
are
free
to
comment
negatively
to
the
patient
because
you
have
complications
wish
they
would
teach
physicians
not
to
use
the
word
uncompliant
with
patients
know
do
request
my
medical
records
medical
records
and
do
read
what
they
say
have
fired
's
after
reading
the
medical
records
medical
records
hire
them
for
a
service
not
for
judgement.\n
'
'\n
'
know
wish
more
's
would
understand
that
being
a
is
not
easy
and
getting
perfect
numbers
is
not
possible
also
wish
they
would
at
least
look
at
my
current
know
went
to
my
current
eye
who
referred
me
to
my
current
know
told
him
my
has
been
been
below
7
for
7
years
now
happened
that
day
to
have
a
copy
of
my
and
he
seemed
shocked
know
he
mentioned
most
of
his
patients
is
not
that
great
but
was
surprised
had
know
's
are
human
but
have
personally
experienced
way
too
much
assuming
and
not
enough
checking
by
's
the
past
couple
of
years
really
wish
they
would
move
toward
not
using
the
word
uncompliant
because
it
is
really
defeating
statement
to
the
patients
who
really
are
trying.\n
'
'\n
'
know
can\'t
change
much
except
addressing
the
currently
see
have
requested
that
one
remove
the
word
uncompliant
from
my
file
because
showed
him
my
and
my
graphs
graphs
all
the
data
don\'t
find
it
fair
that
am
automatically
considered
to
be
a
bad
patient
when
work
so
hard
am
trying
to
let
this
go
emotionally
but
know
it
will
take
time
to
get
over
the
fact
that
can\'t
change
all
's
am
hoping
that
some
day
they
won\'t
use
that
term
about
any
but
for
now
can
only
hope
that
someday
that
is
the
case.\n

\n
2
it
to
yourself\n
'\n
for
the
it
to
5/12
of
us
share
lots
of
aspects
of
our
diabetes
lives
online
for
the
world
to
see
are
some
of
the
aspects
of
diabetes
that
you
choose
to
keep
private
from
the
internet
from
your
family
and
friends
is
it
important
to
keep
it
to
yourself
(
is
not
an
attempt
to
get
you
out
of
your
comfort
zone
is
no
need
to
elaborate
or
tell
personal
stories
related
to
these
aspects
let
us
know
what
kinds
of
stories
we
will
never
hear
you
tell
and
why
you
wo
n't
tell
them
(
you
of
in
the
for
this
topic
)
\n
'\n
'
know
have
always
prided
myself
on
sharing
everything
including
the
moments
of
scary
which
have
had
quite
a
few
of
the
past
seven
year
in
particular
certain
areas
don\'t
share
on
my
blogs
is
who
am
dating
and
if
am
single
etc
feel
that
if
was
married
might
share
a
small
bit
but
am
most
comfortable
just
leaving
that
information
out
know
another
area
won\'t
share
is
other
conditions
outside
my
except
the
one\
's
that
are
other
issues.\n
'
'\n
'
know
do
have
's
and
have
always
shared
as
develop
complications
right
away
on
my
blog
blog
have
found
that
feel
better
if
share
as
it
is
happening
know
did
with
my
but
had
for
several
years
before
started
my
blog
blog
like
to
share
as
it
happens
because
at
one
time
was
looking
for
another
person
who
was
going
through
the
same
complication
but
found
no
blogs
is
why
started
blogging
back
in
of
2012
my
related
information
is
wonderful
in
that
can
put
this
stuff
am
carrying
around
online
instead
of
on
my
own
shoulders
\n
'
'\n
'
know
this
past
year
in
would
not
disclose
what
type
of
procedure
was
having
because
it
was
not
related
but
type
blogged
about
it
because
it
was
causing
many
issues
for
me
with
my
feel
that
sharing
exactly
the
issue
was
best
kept
to
myself
because
know
needed
the
privacy
know
wished
could
share
but
know
that
it
really
was
best
left
unsaid
am
doing
so
much
better
now
with
the
quick
procedure
that
was
done
and
my
graphs
graphs
on
my
are
almost
back
to
they
way
they
were
back
when
first
started
on
the
honestly
had
no
idea
how
much
the
issues
was
causing
issues
with
my
which
does
happen
am
thankful
had
a
wonderful
who
my
recommended
know
think
we
all
have
some
things
that
are
just
not
appropriate
for
our
blogs
know
felt
better
in
the
long
run
not
discussing
it
and
know
having
some
privacy
is
really
nice
in
times
like
these.\n
'
'\n
'
know
am
hoping
you
all
understand
the
reasoning
behind
not
sharing
my
procedure
and
my
dating
life
because
think
that
information
might
create
issues
know
if
you
list
a
person
on
your
blog
anyone
can
read
it
and
so
you
also
need
to
think
about
them
by
leaving
the
off
the
blog
blog
can
discuss
them
without
naming
them
but
find
it
is
just
better
to
keep
my
that
off
my
blog
blog
and
just
in
my
personal
life
will
always
be
parts
of
our
lives
we
won\'t
share

is
the
there
was
a
diabetes
blog
theme
of
can
\xe2\x80\x9d
that
participants
found
wonderfully
empowering
lets
kick
things
off
this
year
by
looking
at
the
positive
side
of
our
lives
with
diabetes
have
you
or
your
loved
one
accomplished
despite
having
diabetes
that
you
weren\'t

you

\n
'
'\n
'
'\n
'
'\n
'
know
wake
up
each
day
knowing
that
their
will
always
be
challenges
for
everyone
including
really
wish
that
my
father
would
understand
it
's
not
1980
anymore
father
when
wanted
to
run
a
half
marathon
said
it
was
too
dangerous
and
should
not
be
running
half
marathons
but
disagree
know
plenty
who
have
am
still
planning
to
run
a
half
marathon
but
after
explore
some
other
adventures
want
to
go
on
know
a
big
part
of
the
reason
my
father
thinks
this
is
because
ca
n't
feel
lows
but
he
also
has
only
seen
the
occasional
low
when
visit
at
so
he
really
has
not
real
concept
of
what
my
life
is
like
today
did
have
a
low
that
needed
assistance
but
my
dad
could
have
given
me
a
glucagon
shot
and
been
fine
\n
'\n
'
know
each
year
my
goal
is
always
the
same
to
reduce
my
lows
and
get
better
at
doing
so
the
longer
have
had
know
will
have
added
precautions
and
planning
even
for
non
exercise
activities
am
okay
with
that
because
you
get
used
to
those
changes
know
my
father
about
lost
it
when
told
him
next
year
am
planning
to
go
to
to
get
training
basically
solo
skydiving
know
most
people
are
thinking
wow
that
is
dangerous
know
most
of
the
adrenaline
junkie
activities
love
are
dangerous
but
am
never
as
happy
as
when
am
going
on
my
next
adrenaline
rush
know
also
plan
for
example
zip
lining
and
a
couple
new
adventures
as
well
know
wo
n't
let
win.\n
'\n
'
know
will
have
critics
who
think
am
reckless
or
foolish
but
know
me
and
what
love
is
about
living
the
life
you
want
and
some
times
getting
the
adrenaline
rush
is
exactly
what
needed
know
went
sky
diving
back
in
and
was
in
a
high
for
three
days
afterwards
and
never
stopped
smiling
felt
like
had
my
zest
for
life
back
and
am
so
know
this
is
what
have
been
missing
in
my
life
know
some
of
my
family
is
like
that
is
awesome
you
love
sky
diving
and
others
are
like
you
ca
n't
do
that
know
can
and
will
be
doing
it
issue
for
me
normally
is
n't
me
doubting
that
can
do
it
but
normally
my
family
or
others.\n
'\n
'
do
plan
on
running
a
half
marathon
but
that
has
been
put
on
hold
while
pursue
skydiving
for
a
while
do
plan
on
pushing
myself
to
achieve
my
goals
and
dreams
have
been
told
no
so
many
times
in
my
life
but
have
always
been
able
to
accomplish
these
goals
know
when
my
tells
me
that
can
go
skydiving
should
be
fine
know
told
her
my
plan
have
for
skydiving
and
she
looked
at
my
graph
for
the
day
and
she
said
looked
great
also
get
better
at
planning
these
activities
a
word
of
advice
do
n't
have
the
notate
in
your
file
you
are
sky
diving
if
you
injure
yourself
the
insurance
wo
n't
cover
it
\n
'\n
'
am
so
over
joyed
that
am
going
to
do
skydiving
because
can
and
honestly
deserve
to
be
happy
like
any
other
person
does
am
tired
of
my
father
trying
to
trap
me
into
the
thought
process
of
the
time
was
diagnosed
where
they
limited
everything
in
life
know
with
all
these
incredible
athletes
why
could
not
know
my
body
has
always
given
me
so
many
challenges
but
do
not
give
up
easily
and
will
continue
to
search
for
my
next
crazy
fun
activity
because
life
is
so
much
better
when
do.\n

at
know
at
time
it
is
so
easy
forget
even
have
since
was
19
know
most
of
the
time
it
is
just
in
the
background
and
don\'t
have
to
do
much
know
since
my
last
flare
up
have
never
really
got
back
to
where
was
previously
know
have
noticed
changes
in
my
hands
and
my
ability
to
open
the
plastic
bags
in
the
produce
section
is
almost
always
too
much
for
me
to
handle
know
am
thrilled
with
my
current
medication
medication
but
it
seems
to
work
okay
but
am
worried
about
the
long
term
changes
with
my
hands
know
recently
have
noticed
that
in
the
mornings
when
am
at
my
stiff
have
trouble
opening
doors
now
and
have
noticed
it
can
at
times
be
painful
to
be
typing
on
the
computer
computer
in
the
mornings
until
have
gotten
my
joints
loosened
up
know
want
to
help
at
times
by
pressing
the
button
on
the
door
but
they
are
so
stiff
she
can\'t
am
stuck
having
to
hit
the
button
which
hurts
know
need
to
discuss
this
with
my
next
week.\n
'
'\n
'
know
she
has
always
considered
my
to
be
mild
and
not
even
moderate
but
with
the
recent
changes
am
not
sure
what
to
think
know
work
out
frequently
but
normally
seem
to
handle
it
pretty
well
do
know
that
the
recent
changes
make
me
really
nervous
that
won\'t
get
back
to
the
way
things
used
to
be
know
my
medication
current
medication
worked
really
well
at
first
but
not
so
much
now
know
it
is
supposed
to
help
stop
the
progression
of
my
but
feel
like
that
is
not
the
case
currently
issue
have
found
is
that
normally
with
you
can\'t
use
advil
my
will
not
tolerate
the
use
of
acetaminophen
basically
if
hurt
myself
can\'t
use
any
pain
relief
medications.\n
'
'\n
'
know
tend
to
be
clumsy
at
times
and
have
had
to
just
grin
and
bear
it
but
at
other
times
take
the
risk
and
take
the
know
this
is
not
recommended
because
it
reduces
the
effectiveness
of
the
have
only
done
it
once
or
twice
now
am
questioning
in
general
what
can
do
am
hoping
my
will
help
me
find
a
solution
but
am
feeling
more
and
more
like
this
current
medication
medication
is
not
for
me
know
am
willing
to
try
new
medications
with
the
hopes
they
last
right
up
to
when
can
take
my
next
dose
know
most
of
the
time
feel
the
medication
wearing
off
on
night
and
can\'t
take
more
till
night
so
technically
might
just
need
a
higher
dosage
but
trying
to
juggle
my
needs
need
to
avoid
because
of
the
just
makes
things
even
more
complicated
\n
'
'\n
'

with
the
love
the
concept
of
the
and
what
it
can
do
for
most
people
know
am
the
exception
in
that
my
numbers
on
the
tend
to
inaccurate
for
example
last
nigh
ate
dinner
as
usual
and
head
to
the
gym
gym
start
working
out
and
expect
to
see
my
blood
sugars
rise
during
the
beginning
of
my
work
out
since
do
not
bolus
for
my
meal
before
going
to
the
gym
gym
start
working
out
and
am
20
minutest
into
my
workout
and
look
at
my
and
it
has
one
pointed
straight
up
but
was
expecting
to
see
my
showing
that
it
was
leveling
off
and
will
be
showing
a
drop
continued
working
out
another
five
minutes
runs
over
to
my
machine
and
stares
at
me
know
the
look
when
need
to
check
finish
the
last
two
minutes
and
then
test
enough
was
actually
69
and
the
still
had
me
moving
up
when
was
actually
low.\n
'
'\n
'
know
during
these
times
having
is
really
important
great
deal
of
the
time
my
will
say
it
is
moving
up
quickly
when
it
is
not
most
of
the
time
always
test
to
see
where
actually
am
know
even
when
have
had
bad
lows
where
needed
assistance
normally
40
minutes
after
the
event
the
finally
catches
up
am
not
sure
why
there
is
such
a
delay
but
also
know
that
's
is
even
worse
for
me
do
the
best
can
with
the
information
have
have
recently
moved
my
blood
sugar
down
when
start
working
out
starting
my
blood
sugar
levels
at
a
lower
than
my
actual
number
has
helped
improve
the
accuracy
of
the
alerts
some
what
am
seeing
it
alert
ten
minutes
after
my
low
instead
of
40
minutes
have
not
run
into
any
issues
with
doing
so
was
worried
about
highs
but
that
has
not
been
an
issue
so
far.\n

know
recently
have
noticed
that
my
medication
medication
does
not
seem
to
be
working
as
well
as
it
once
was
am
not
sure
if
need
a
higher
dosage
or
just
need
to
change
medications
know
the
medication
for
the
most
part
has
worked
well
but
it
really
has
some
down
sides
to
taking
this
medication
do
lose
more
of
my
hair
than
normal
it
tend
to
catch
more
colds
and
can\'t
drink
more
than
two
drinks
in
one
week
know
most
of
the
time
it
seems
to
work
okay
but
an
issue
have
noticed
is
that
by
of
each
week
can
feel
more
pain
and
stiffness
is
like
the
medication
stops
on
evening
and
am
unable
to
take
more
until
evening
know
each
morning
have
noticed
that
have
had
increasing
difficulty
with
my
hands
and
being
able
to
get
my
body
to
function
like
normal
know
my
up
coming
appointment
with
my
know
have
some
issue
to
discuss.\n
'
'\n
'
am
not
really
sure
what
the
is
going
to
recommend
but
after
a
year
of
the
am
not
feeling
like
it
is
for
me
am
hoping
she
is
willing
to
help
me
find
a
drug
that
will
not
have
as
many
restrictions
like
does
such
as
have
to
limit
sun
exposure
which
is
difficult
when
living
in
also
need
to
avoid
people
who
are
sick
because
it
does
suppress
the
immune
system
am
not
able
to
even
enjoy
the
occasional
drink
with
friends
because
it
can
elevate
the
levels
of
your
liver
which
is
not
good
know
am
not
really
happy
at
this
point
and
am
hoping
they
have
other
options
available
but
also
know
my
insurance
only
covers
one
or
two
medications
currently
the
rest
are
not
covered
my
choices
are
limited
which
does
not
help
know
is
that
today
at
work
have
needed
to
get
up
more
because
my
medication
medication
does
seem
effective
enough
can
get
some
results
need
soon.\n

know
have
been
thinking
back
to
my
several
years
ago
know
started
my
blog
blog
around
the
time
my
showed
up
in
my
life
remember
woke
up
one
morning
and
noticed
black
spots
in
my
vision
which
were
small
hemorrhages
in
my
eye
went
to
the
eye
that
day
because
was
concerned
took
one
look
and
said
that
had
a
was
told
with
my
eyes
dilated
needed
to
go
to
the
now
left
the
office
very
scared
know
they
rushed
me
back
immediately
when
arrived
at
the
office
nurse
comes
in
and
starts
to
ask
me
questions
know
she
said
they
believe
have
and
knew
that
was
most
likely
the
case
nurse
then
says
to
me
guess
you
should
have
taken
better
care
of
yourself
told
the
nurse
that
was
not
the
case
and
did
not
deserve
to
be
treated
this
way
told
her
to
leave
her
judgement
at
the
door.\n
'
'\n
'
thing
the
comes
in
and
looks
at
my
eye
says
the
good
news
is
that
do
n't
have
a
but
do
have
also
had
quite
a
few
new
blood
vessels
which
are
leaking
and
hemorrhaging
they
say
need
to
be
treated
immediately
says
to
help
stop
of
the
bleeding
need
to
have
an
injection
into
my
eye
know
when
he
said
that
was
shocked
that
was
what
they
were
going
to
do
have
always
had
a
thing
about
anything
being
close
to
my
eye
so
it
was
difficult
hated
the
injections
they
were
not
painful
but
they
worked
really
well
was
told
needed
to
come
back
for
more
procedures
which
they
used
dyes
which
could
show
the
blood
flow
in
the
eyes
called
an
angiogram
also
did
regular
pictures
and
other
exams
know
it
was
an
overwhelming
experience
and
know
was
extremely
scared
at
the
time
decided
that
would
take
things
one
day
at
a
time
also
knew
that
wanted
to
make
sure
my
was
under
6.5
to
prevent
any
further
complications
and
actually
had
been
in
that
range
for
several
years
so
just
needed
to
make
sure
stayed
in
range.\n
'\n
'
know
they
then
said
needed
laser
procedures
done
which
was
okay
with
had
no
idea
that
it
could
be
as
painful
as
it
was
also
had
no
idea
that
my
specialist
at
the
time
was
not
following
the
standard
procedure
for
doing
laser
procedures
had
me
laying
back
in
a
chair
trying
to
laser
my
eye
but
that
did
not
work
because
my
eye
was
watering
the
whole
time
you
are
in
an
up
right
position
sitting
as
the
does
the
laser
procedure
know
my
then
told
me
needed
to
have
a
since
the
laser
was
not
working
know
that
seemed
wrong
he
only
tried
twice
to
laser
my
eyes
went
to
get
a
second
opinion
meet
another
young
woman
who
had
and
she
spent
time
talking
with
me
found
out
that
if
you
do
have
a
you
could
also
need
further
surgeries
and
she
had
several
told
me
to
try
and
see
if
the
laser
procedures
worked
first
and
not
to
jump
into
surgery.\n
'
'\n
'
took
her
advice
changed
and
he
did
laser
procedures
and
a
year
and
half
later
have
had
not
procedures
done
and
no
bleeding
know
the
surgery
seems
like
a
good
idea
but
for
me
knew
just
wanted
to
avoid
the
surgery
if
at
all
possible
for
me
it
worked
know
my
experience
is
not
typical
but
we
need
to
all
communicate
what
we
need
me
avoiding
surgery
has
been
a
blessing
and
today
still
have
20/20
vision
and
no
new
blood
vessel
growth
in
my
eyes
do
work
everyday
to
keep
my
eyes
healthy
by
keep
my
in
a
good
range
and
exercising.\n
'
'\n
'
know
this
journey
was
scary
and
encourage
everyone
to
share
because
know
did
not
find
any
one
sharing
their
experiences
several
years
ago
can
be
incredibly
scary
but
know
for
me
found
taking
it
one
day
at
a
time
made
it
all
manageable
also
did
a
great
deal
of
research
which
helped
me
have
realistic
expectations
know
felt
better
knowing
about
procedures
before
they
were
done
made
it
a
point
to
read
up
and
educate
myself
know
do
n't
know
what
would
have
done
without
my
friend
online
who
shared
her
experience
know
made
the
decisions
needed
to
make
for
me
know
learned
need
to
advocate
for
myself
as
well
know
some
of
the
best
advice
my
gave
me
is
to
sleep
on
two
pillows
to
help
keep
blood
from
flowing
into
your
field
of
vision
when
sleeping
hemorrhages
happen
when
you
are
asleep
first
did
not
share
this
advice
so
felt
he
just
was
their
for
the
money
always
wanting
me
to
go
for
a
surgery
know
have
never
been
happier
to
fire
a
than
that
one.\n
'\n
'
know
today
my
eyes
are
doing
great
and
hope
to
see
them
continue
to
be
in
good
condition
know
have
learned
so
much
from
my
experience
also
did
not
realize
how
strong
was
until
walked
this
road
alone
know
hope
everyone
continues
to
share
their
experiences
because
it
means
the
world
to
someone
who
is
going
through
it
completely
scared
know
that
my
combination
of
therapies
of
injections
laser
and
keeping
down
have
all
helped
me
to
get
my
stable
and
stay
stable
the
past
several
years.\n

in
case
you
didn\'t
know
we
have
a
ghost
puppy
who
lives
in
our
house
1
house
through
the
front
door
does
a
lot
of
bad
stuff
like
chewing
up

emptying

'life
lately
\n
'
'\n
'
's
been
a
while
since
've
posted
on
here
over
the
last
year
really
have
stepped
back
from
my
blog
blog
a
little
more
so
in
the
last
six
months
've
just
not
been
feeling
that
inspired
with
it
the
more
try
to
focus
on
my
blog
blog
the
more
compare
myself
my
photography
and
writing
skills
to
others
which
is
unnecessarily
bringing
me
down
let\
's
be
honest
work
so
at
the
weekend
sometimes
all
want
to
do
is
be
lazy
and
spend
time
with
my
boyfriend
and
family
absolutely
love
my
blog
blog
and
what
having
it
has
done
for
me
but
right
now
'm
doing
what
can
to
keep
my
happiness
levels
up
let
me
tell
you
really
am
pretty
happy
\n
'
'\n
'
in
my
life
have
been
going
pretty
well
this
year
've
been
feeling
so
content
've
started
to
get
the
itch
to
move
out
into
my
own
home
hello
endless
interior
shopping
and
settling
down
a
little
but
'm
not
in
too
much
of
a
rush
and
know
that
things
will
happen
at
the
right
time
for
me
've
reached
a
milestone
on
my
savings
savings
and
've
been
making
the
most
of
the
time
spend
with
my
family
which
are
two
of
my
priorities
at
the
moment
\n
you
haven\'t
worked
it
out
from
my
and
yet
've
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
time
with
the
most
amazin\
guy
never
believed
it
when
people
would
say
you\
'll
meet
someone
when
you
least
expect
it
but
in
this
case
it
certainly
was
true
'm
a
pretty
emotional
and
sentimental
person
so
won\'t
ramble
on
for
too
long
but
being
in
love
and
knowing
that
'm
with
someone
who
loves
me
for
who
am
has
made
me
feel
so
overwhelmed
with
happiness
my
manager
has
said
that
when
she
looks
at
me
she
can
see
heart
emojis
above
my
head
haha
\n
'
ca
n't
believe
that
've
been
in
my
new
job
for
five
months
already
that
sometimes
it
feels
like
longer
's
all
been
quite
a
learning
curve
for
me
but
'm
really
proud
of
my
career
progress
over
the
last
3
years
from
a
sales
assistant
to
a
visual
merchandiser
then
the
and
at
before
moving
to
to
become
their
dabbling
as
a
stylist
in
between
of
this
without
going
to
university
shows
it
is
possible
and
even
better
have
no
debts
to
pay
off
\n
wrote
my
blog
\'flaws
and
all\

post
back
in
things
have
remained
pretty
similar
've
been
taking
little
steps
to
improve
my
confidence
complexion
health
and
fitness
and
besides
two
little
blips
since
then
thanks
to
the
pill
and
anxiety
things
have
been
lookin\

a
short
and
sweet
post
from
me
today

cosied
up
on
the
sofa

feelin\
very
happy
as
today
marks
the
start
of
ten
days
have
off
work
's
been
a
long
few
months
so
'm
super
excited
to

some
time
with
my
family
in
sleep
in
and
catch
up
on
general
life
admin
plan
to
put
together
a
little
\'life

post
soon
so
can
update
y\'all
up
on
just
what
has
been
going
on
in
my
life
and
quite
a
few
lovely
things
have
happened
recently
have
to
say
)
so
do
look
out
for
that
\n
'
to
the
outfit
on
from
my
last
outfit
post
this
look
was
also
shot
by
the
lovely
on
a
chilly
day
in
dress
dress
has
become
my
go
to
outfit
as
of
late
it\
's
super
flattering
for
my
shape
as
it
nips
in
at
the
waist
giving
me
the
illusion
of
hips
wahey
and
the
length
is
just
perfect
with
my
boots
extra
sassy
knee
high
boots
and
a
fedora
classic
fedora
this
combo
certainly
did
make
me
feel
fancy
enough
for
my
surroundings

've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
how
this
maintenance
journey
is
about
holding
seemingly
opposing
concepts
first
concept
goes
like
this
\r\n
'\r\n
'
is
not
ok
to
overeat
is
not
ok
to
mindlessly
eat
a
bunch
of
junk
is
not
ok
to
engage
in
bingy
behaviors
that
leave
me
feeling
regretful
and
yucky
is
not
ok
to
skip
my
workouts
is
not
ok
to
eat
in
a
non-goal-oriented
way.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
the
second
concept
is
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
it
happens
it
's
ok.\r\n
'\r\n
'
is
a
contradiction
and
our
brains
do
n't
really
like
that
it
's
a
dissonance
we
have
to
get
used
to
we
have
to
teach
our
brains
to
hold
both
because
both
are
true.\r\n
'\r\n
'
do
do
that
of
it
is
about
staying
in
the
moment
was
in
my
mid-20
's
read
by
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
concept
of
mindfulness
is
about
being
in
the
present
moment
we
stay
in
the
present
moment
we
can
really
only
hold
one
of
the
above
concepts
at
a
time.\r\n
'\r\n
'
this
moment
these
choices
are
not
ok
and
will
not
accept
them
this
moment
will
hold
that
eating
a
ton
of
chocolate
at
the
staff
meeting
just
because
someone
brought
it
is
not
permitted
who
's
authority
is
it
not
permitted
my
own
of
course
am
the
only
one
in
charge
here.\r\n
'\r\n
'
an
hour
later
when
my
authority
was
compromised
by
me
must
hold
something
different
happened
it
's
ok
this
moment
it
is
ok.
if
it
's
not
have
to
scold
point
fingers
and
otherwise
assign
blame
can
lead
to
shame
leads
to
weakness
hiding
fear
of
those
feelings
will
help
me
make
the
next
right
decision.\r\n
'\r\n
'
it\
's
ok
in
this
moment
then
not
started
out
by
saying
we
have
to
hold
both
but
guess
what
've
described
by
bringing
in
this
mindfulness
idea
is
that
we
only
have
to
hold
one
a
time
dissonance
no
conflict
question
becomes
what
is
true
in
this
moment
do
need
right
now
to
move
toward
my
goals
need
hold
that
the
other
other
is
not
here
in
this
moment
other
can
be
used
in
some
other
moment
when
it
is
needed.\r\n
might
also
like
\r\n
is
of
the
and
30
on
the
9:59

2015\r\n
and
a
were
getting
better
with
my
back
until
they
were
n't
'd
hoped
to
get
out
for
a
run
or
something
this
weekend
but
it
did
n't
happen
've
been
averaging
twice
a
week
for
exercise
which
you
know
is
n't
making
me
happy
'm
taking
my
own
advice
focusing
on
a
mix
of
patience
and
confidence
will
get
better
my
body
will
come
around.\r\n
'\r\n
'\r\n
the
eating
front
'm
eating
days
too
much
but
mostly
staying
within
reasonable
boundaries
'm
going
out
more
than
typically
do
building
up
a
social
life
and
finding
ways
to
be
out
in
the
world
meeting
people
trying
to
have
fun
much
of
being
social
involves
food
'm
posting
a
couple
pictures
pictures
from
recent
outings.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
focus
on
the
at-home
meals
as
being
clean
whole
light
meals
which
then
allows
me
to
indulge
when
'm
either
restaurant
dining
or
at
a
dinner
party
that
can
indulge
at
every
restaurant
meal
or
dinner
party
the
calories
would
add
up
use
calories
for
lack
of
a
better
word
think
you
know
don\'t
count
calories.\r\n
'\r\n
'\r\n
view
from
the
bar
at
'm
not
sticking
to
this
as
well
as
'd
like
evidenced
by
for
example
my
eating
salami
for
dinner
lately
when
'm
home
home
alone
crackers
a
string
cheese
maybe
a
bowl
bowl
of
cereal
salami
dinners
are
more
like
grazed
snacking
and
have
a
couple
problems
with
this
behavior.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
don\'t
feel
so
great
physically
when
eat
like
this
notice
my
body
isn\'t
in
the
same
groove
skin
doesn\'t
like
it
and
my
system
gets
wonky
well
second
are
the
calories
of
course
my
plan
is
at-home
meals
that
are
clean
and
light
salami
must
be
the
complete
opposite
of
clean
and
light
good
news
the
salami
is
gone
finally
ran
out
last
night
won\'t
be
buying
more
for
the
time
being.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
that
said
my
weight
is
staying
within
range
was
144
pounds
last
was
a
4+
pound
drop
from
the
week
prior
which
is
crazy
expect
it
will
bounce
back
up
by
a
couple
pounds
this
week
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
enough
about
all
that
have
a
tummy
tuck
update
healing
from
the
surgery
noticed
my
skin
was
a
little
funny
where
the
incision
ended
near
my
hips
kind
of
crinkled
up
this
happens
a
lot
so
the
doctor
said
he
could
fix
it
when
'm
ready
'd
paid
extra
to
have
my
love
handles
removed
but
they
are
still
there
so
he
's
fixing
that
too
'm
scheduled
to
go
in
for
what
'm
calling
a
touch-up
in
going
under
the
knife
again
hopefully
for
the
last
time
'm
sure
'll
post
pictures
after
all
is
said
and
done.\r\n
'\r\n
'
else
in
life
is
going
well
kids
are
doing
great
and
are
humming
along
with
our
new
life
all
working
together
for
the
greatest
good
'm
enjoying
the
ride
might
sign
up
for
a
tri
training
plan
just
to
give
me
some
structure
even
if
do
n't
actually
do
the
tri
on
this

come.\r\n
might
also

back
flared
up
again
the
past
had
a
pretty
good
idea
what
caused
it
but
this
time
wasn\'t
certain
my
last
blog
blog
post
wrote
about
going
on
a
6
mile
trail
run/hike
went
to
the
gym
gym
for
the
next
three
days
in
a
row
and
remembered
working
out
pretty
hard
felt
really
strong
and
good
and
was
dealing
with
stress
that
was
taking
out
on
the
dumbbells.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
the
pain
grew
to
the
point
at
which
had
to
stop
exercising
altogether
for
a
couple
weeks
was
able
to
get
back

of
here-and-there
not

is
not
100

maybe
75

still
treating
it
with
my

looking
forward
to
getting
back
to
something
regular
my

is
n't
ready
for
that
just
yet.\r\n

the
food
front
things
continue
to
go
pretty
well
'm
still
attending
meetings
every
week
for
a
reminder
for
inspiration
and
motivation
haven\'t
been
tracking
lately
my
weight
is
back
in
my
official
goal
window
145-149
)
but
just
barely
in
all
'm
quite
happy
with
how
things
are
going
in
this
department
feels
as
though
'm
starting
to
get
a
more
intuitive
relationship
with
food
the
foundation
of
that
being
have
a
radical
knowledge
that
can
eat
whatever
want
and
however
much
want
the
choices
are
mine
and
mine
alone.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
on
that
the
final
thing
happening
is
have
a
cold
blocked
up
nose
hyped
up
on
cold
cold
meds

it\
's
coinciding
with
this
back
pain
thing
so
'm
not
getting
sidelined
by
it
hope
is
that
about
the
time
the
cold
goes
away
maybe
my
back
will
be
ready
for
more
regular

an

are
better
than

was
an
other
thing
though
the
last
few
times
've
had
monster-bad
days
have
n't
wanted
to
eat
the
way-back
past
would
've
wanted
a
bag
of
chips
and
a
pint
of
ice
cream
for
an
appetizer

it
's
as
if

n't
really
enjoy

in

jolt
of
pain

sadness
it
does
n't
really
last
it
a
day

two

'll
probably
want
to
dive
head-first
into

from
the
state

well

the

hit
my

to
exercise
four

went
to
the

on
and
did
a
light
post-half
recovery
workout
was
hit
with
a
wave
of
exhaustion
in
the
late
afternoon
and
thought
it
smart
to
get
some
rest
did
just
run
13.1
miles
on
after
all.\r\n

and
saw
me
hitting

after

and
doing
my

still
not
doing
what
used
to
do
before
this
whole

reached
a
peak

that\
's
ok
'll
get
there
eventually.\r\n

back
to

2.2

was
no

gained
3.2

prior

is
happening

jumping
around

curious
to

what
it
will
be
this

149.8
which
is
.8

over
what

allowed

is
147

this
is
the
week.\r\n

with

comforted
myself
by
mentally
increasing
the
mileage
in

run
by
1
mile
with
every
passing
hour
decided
to
just
wipe
out
all
the
had
left
plus
any
unused
including
those

this
is

it
's

around

were
either

steep
up/downhill

hard

the

rocky/narrow

to

stiff
from

with

around
my

2.34

much
from

the
number

because
my

were
just
not
up
to
it

after
about
2/3
of

just
stopped
altogether

was

happy
and
was
n't
in
the
mood
to
push
it
from
my
being
emotionally
tired
probably
did
n't

enough
to
fuel
what
was

do
either.\r\n

half
on

fine
to

in
some

always
a

the

by
having
two

one
vanilla
and
one
chocolate

gave
it
my

up

check
out

the

there
just
as

gotten
there
literally
a

later

would
have
missed
it

off
to

bread
pasta
with

even
though

had
the

can
get
away
with
stuff

that
when
you\
'll

for
over
two
hours
in
the
morning
\r\n

dinner
went
to
an
art
theater
across
the
street
to
watch
one
of
my
all-time
favorite
movies
know
it\
's
kind
of
cheesy
camp
fun
but
love
it
's
kind
of
like
my
personal
and
the
fact
that
it
was
playing
in
the
city
the
night
before
my
race
when
had
to
be
right
across
the
street
to
get
my
packet

was
just
too
perfect.\r\n

'\r\n
'
'\r\n

and
'd
be
running
soon.\r\n
the
movie
it
was
straight
to

6:30am

is
going
to

an
early
wake
up.\r\n

in

just
a

from

up

around
the

hoping
to
go

before
the

aside
from

physical
concerns
knowing
all
the

put
into

the

with

some
coffee

nothing

my

longingly
at

had
a
need
to
use
one
but
my
system
was
just
not
budging
had
no
time
to
wait

have
to
run
the

just

my
full
system
would
n't
be
a

in

got
there
about
10
minutes
before
the

took
off

dark
out

right
on

off

made
a
decision
will
be
my
last
blog
blog
post
.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
the
very
beginning
always
said
that
would
wake
up
one
day
and
pull
the
plug
on
the
madness
without
warning
day
is
today
right
now
many
reasons
and
for
none
at
all
been
so
tempted
to
do
it
for
the
past
six
months
only
reason
have
not
is
because
am
still
contacted
weekly
by
other
suicide
widows
and
know
my
words
are
helping
them
to
feel
saner
still
want
that
to
be
the
case
only
it
will
have
to
be
in
a
different
venue

many
people
asked
me
about
the
anticipated
book
last
weekend
at

blown
away
that

would
read

going

be

hear
it
is
ill
advised
to
hand

the
sarcastic
musings

tend
to
agree
with
this
assessment.\r\n

my
head
is
spinning
minute
we
were
at
the

decide
whether
to
eat
the

at

through

out

morning
after

on
the
\n
'
'\n
'
my
last
update
we
were
dealing
with
a
denied
offer
a
day
full
of
disappointing
showings
and
our
begrudging
return
to
the
hunt
people
am
a
story-teller
and
refuse
to
disappoint.\n
'
'\n
'
here
's
what
's
happened
\n
'textconvo\n
'
picked
ourselves
up
from
the
day
of
terrible
disappointing
showings
and
kept
checking
every
single
listing
that
popped
on
the
market
within
of
it
coming
on
the
market
mean
it
when
say
this
is
a
part-time
job
has
been
detrimental
to
be
one
of
the
first
showings
on
a
good
house.\n
house
came
up
on
the
market
on
afternoon
and
looked
it
over
and
got
pretty
obsessed
fact
the
texting
convo
to
the
right
was
our
reaction
emailed
our
twice
in
3
minutes
and
told
her
we
wanted
to
see
it
and
then
also
texted
her
to
make
sure
she
knew
the
extent
of
our
craziness.\n
got
us
a
showing
the
following
day
and
it
was
exactly
as
we
'd
hoped
we
knew
others
had
seen
it
before
us
we
put
in
a
really
strong
offer
before
the
day
was
out
to
which
they
had
24
hours
to
accept
or
deny.\n
'\n
'
'\n
'
we
waited
and
waited
and
after
24
hours
had
passed
we
got
word
that
they
had
received
multiple
offers
and
they
wanted
everyone
's
highest
and
best
by
at
5pm
decided
our
first
offer
was
truly
the
strongest
we
could
do
so
we
left
it
the
same
not
knowing
how
many
others
we
were
against
we
offered
their
list
price
and
we
assumed
others
went
over
is
actually
really
common
in
the
market
here
and
in
other
cities.\n
they
would
get
the
offers
and
choose
the
highest
one
we
expected
to
hear
something
before
the
end
of
the
day
or
in
the
morning
on
we
would
lose
this
beautiful
house
wrote
the
owners
a
heartfelt
letter
praising
them
for
taking
such
immaculate
care
of
their
home
and
property
complimented
them
and
then
explained
that
we
were
looking
for
our
first
home
and
yada
yada
yada
went
cheesy
and
talked
about
our
future
children
and
how
really
want
to
raise
them
in
this
home
put
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
but
admitted
that
understood
it
has
to
come
down
to
their
best
financial
choice
had
my
pass
on
the
letter
and
let
it
be
\n
'
that
night
our
called
and
asked
if
was
with
told
me
to
put
her
on
speakerphone
because
offer
would
have
netted
them
more
money
but
we
have
a
flexible
closing
date
and
wrote
the
world\
's
sweetest
letter
so
we
won
are
over
the
moon
excited
and
grateful
!
\n
'
'\n
'
now
the
clock
starts
ticking
due
diligence
starts
tomorrow
means
we
have
to
officially
put
down
our
earnest
money
meet
with
our
loan
officer
and
see
what
they
can
officially
work
out
for
a
loan
and
get
an
appraisal
and
home
inspection
done
which
for
the
sake
of
transparency
adds
up
to
or
more
that
the
buyer
pays
out
of
pocket
and
if
you
end
up
deciding
the
property
needs
too
much
work
wo
n't
appraise
near
enough
to
your
offer
and
the
sellers
wo
n't
negotiate
down
you
just
lose
that
money
and
never
see
it
again
just
you
find
out
its
actual
worth
or
any
issues
it
has
you
negotiate
that
the
seller
needs
to
fix
this
or
that
or
they
need
to
bring
down
the
price
to
come
closer
to
appraisal
this
happens
in
only
weeks
or
less.\n
'\n
'
is
all
very
exciting
and
we
definitely
spent
night
talking
about
how
we\
'd
decorate
it
and
where
we
can
put
our
furniture
furniture
but
anything
could
happen
and
we
or
they
could
choose
to
back
out
we
end
up
needing
to
renegotiate
and
one
side
or
another
doesn\'t
budge
that
could
cause
this
train
to
leave
the
station
that
doesn\'t
happen
but
we
need
to
keep
it
in
mind
house
isn\'t
ours
until
the
keys
are
in
hand
\n
'
'\n
'
so
much
for
reading
along
(
this
was
super
wordy
sorry
)
and
please
send
us
your
prayers
that
all
goes
smooth
and
without
a
hitch
\n
'
'\n
'
advice
for
this
point
we
should
remember
to
look
for
while
walking
through
with
an
inspector
we
should
n't
forget
to
do
perhaps

months
ago
at
this
exact
moment
was
hyperventilating
in
my
hospital
room
and
trying
to
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
was
about
to
have
part
of
my
leg
removed
some
ways
it
feels
like
just
had
my
surgery
a
few
weeks
ago
but
in
other
ways
it
feels
like
been
an
amputee
my
whole
life.\n
'
'\n
'
past
six
months
have
been
nothing
short
of
incredible
grown
changed
and
become
stronger
been
constantly
reminded
of
just
how
great
the
little
things
in
life
are
a
result
of
the
event
that
occurred
on
25
2014
had
some
amazing
experiences
including
speaking
at
schools
and
retreats
being
part
of
a
council
at
the
hospital
and
participating
in
a
commercial
finished
my
first
post-amp
dipped
my
toes
in
the
ocean
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
learned
how
to
drive
again.\n
'
'\n
'
be
lying
if
said
that
the
past
six
months
have
been
perfect
or
without
challenges
certainly
has
not
been
easy
patience
has
been
tested
as
have
had
to
wait
for
things
a
leg
leg
the
ability
to
drive
and
the
freedom
to
walk
unassisted
to
name
a
few
worked
through
post-op
pain
discomfort
from
overuse
of
my
leg
leg
and
soreness
from
tough
sessions
although
it
did
not
all
come
easily
it\xe2\x80\x99s
all
been
beyond
worth
it.\n
'
'\n
'
you
told
me
six
months
ago
that
be
this
happy
right
now
would\xe2\x80\x99ve
probably
said
something
like
\xe2\x80\x9csure
keep
telling
yourself
that.\xe2\x80\x9d
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
believe
that
life
would
ever
be
bright
and
happy
again
though
wake
up
each
day
with
gratitude
in
my
heart
for
how
far
gotten
am
so
thankful
for
everyone
who
has
followed
my
story
sent
prayers
my
way
and
supported
me
through
it
all
would\xe2\x80\x99ve
known
that
something
so
dark
and
so
scary
could
give
way
to
something
so
beautiful
am
humbled
to
be
where
am
today.\n
'
'\n
'
tears
and
those
fears
on
the
morning
of
my
surgery
would
have
disappeared
immediately
if
would
have
known
then
how
amazing
my
life
would
soon
become
am
so
undeserving
of
this
wonderful
journey
but
am
so
grateful
for
the
life
been
given.\n

other
day
was
in
the
store
when
heard
a
little
girl
call
out
to
her
mom
come
here
girl\xe2\x80\x93why
does
she
look\xe2\x80\x93
\xe2\x80\x9d
mom
tried
to
hush
her
before
she
went
on
explain
it
to
you
but
you
have
to
come
over
here
\xe2\x80\x9d
she
said
leading
her
daughter
to
a
different
area
they
came
back
to
where
was
the
girl
and
her
brother
tried
to
catch
another
glance
at
my
leg
leg
while
their
mom
tried
to
stop
them
from
staring
by
offering
other
things
to
look
at.\n
'
'\n
'
think
situations
like
the
one
described
above
come
from
the
desire
to
not
intrude
or
offend
don\xe2\x80\x99t
want
to
say
or
do
the
wrong
thing
especially
around
people
who
are
\xe2\x80\x9cdifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d
totally
understandable
but
sometimes
think
our
avoidance
is
counterproductive
hear
people
talking
about
my
leg
leg
in
hushed
voices
or
pulling
their
kids
away
from
me
to
talk
about
what
they
think
happened
it
only
magnifies
the
idea
that
something
is
\xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d
with
me
(
note
don\xe2\x80\x99t
actually
think
anything
is
wrong
with
me
and
the
world
knows
how
proud
am
of
my
leg
leg
when
situations
like
this
happen
it
communicates
that
idea
to
others
idea
that
something
is
wrong
and
that
it
shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
be
talked
about
it
should
)
\n
'
'\n
'
is
different
but
for
me
personally
rather
people
just
ask
about
what
happened
rather
than
trying
to
conjure
their
own
explanations
am
an
open
book
as
said
multiple
times
rather
answer
questions
personally
than
have
people
get
the
wrong
impression
about
my
amputation.\n
'
'\n
'
try
to
avoid
awkward
conversations
and
uncomfortable
situations
think
that\xe2\x80\x99s
normal
there
are
ways
to
acknowledge
these
things
without
making
a
bigger
deal
out
of
it
mother
that
described
could
have
simply
told
her
kids
that
had
a
prosthetic
leg
prosthetic
leg
and
let
it
at
that
could
have
said
something
that
would
allow
her
kids
to
know
that
disabilities
and
differences
are
to
be
celebrated
not
shushed
of
making
her
children
feel
like
they
did
something
wrong

someone
who
loves
to
have
everything
planned
out
this
season
of
life
has
been\xe2\x80\xa6well
a
bit
hectic
guess
it\xe2\x80\x99s
really
more
than
just
a
season
since
my
life
has
been
one
change
after
another
for
the
past
nine
years
or
so
has
been
a
constant
journey
of
trusting
that
everything
will
somehow
work
out
even
when
don\xe2\x80\x99t
understand
what
is
happening
in
a
given
moment.\n
'
'\n
'
when
start
to
get
settled
and
comfortable
something
happens
to
change
up
my
plans
has
been
particularly
evident
lately
in
my
academic
life
think
know
where
going
and
what
want
to
do
and
changes
think
that\xe2\x80\x99s
pretty
normal
for
college
students
though
people
change
majors
more
than
once
so
don\xe2\x80\x99t
feel
too
abnormal
about
that
people
also
change
schools\xe2\x80\xa6which
also
have
done
think
that
part
of
my
identity
has
been
wrapped
up
in
who
wanted
to
be
and
what
wanted
to
do
in
the
future
which
is
why
this
newest
change
in
my
life
has
been
necessary
but
difficult.\n
'
'\n
'
the
past
few
years
have
had
a
plan
about
my
future
career
goals
knew
what
wanted
to
study
looked
into
different
ways
to
get
my
degree
and
thought
everything
was
good
to
go
and
family
commented
on
how
great
of
a
career
choice
had
and
how
wonderful
it
was
that
would
be
getting
my
degree
within
the
next
few
years
the
way
though
hit
several
roadblocks
detours
and
signs
that
maybe
there
was
something
else
that
was
supposed
to
do
dreams
were
good
but
maybe
they
weren\xe2\x80\x99t
the
best.\n
'
'\n
'
been
feeling
a
push
to
leave
my
desired
major
and
take
a
different
path
been
a
huge
topic
of
discussion
and
debate
a
process
of
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
going
with
the
new
plan
that
feel
led
toward
done
some
research
talked
to
multiple
people
and
discussed
things
with
the
upstairs
it\xe2\x80\x99s
hard
to
push
aside
the
ideal
plans
that
had
made
it
has
become
more
clear
that
something
else
is
up
ahead
that
don\xe2\x80\x99t
fully
understand
right
now
but
that
hope
will
make
more
sense
along
the
way.\n
'
'\n
'
of
this
week
decided
to
let
go
of
my
previous
plans
and
go
down
a
different
road
switching
majors
and
hoping
to
graduate
next
year
rather
than
in
three
years

will
no
longer
be
held
in
my

something
that
feeling
a

peace
about
so
this
is
the
way
am
choosing
to
go
don\xe2\x80\x99t
know
what
the
future
holds
in
terms
of
my
education
and
career
but
at
least
have
a
start.\n
'
'\n
'
though
feel
peace
about
my
decision
letting
go
of
my
plans
is
not
easy
think
that
know
what\xe2\x80\x99s
best
for
my
life
so
cling
to
my
\xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d
plan
in
reality
don\xe2\x80\x99t
always
know
what\xe2\x80\x99s
best
people
see
things
that
am
blind
to
feel
nudges
about
taking
a
different
route
do
not
always
know
the
best
way
to
live
my
life
when
it\xe2\x80\x99s
challenging

to

what
happened
yesterday
if
you\xe2\x80\x99ve
read
the
title
then
you
had
my
last
day
of
though
going
to
miss
going
over
to
the
hospital
on
a
regular
basis
happy
that
am
well
enough
to
leave
behind
the
days
of
multiple
appointments
per
week.\n
'
'\n
'
so
encouraging
to
look
back
and
see
how
far
come
in
the
past
3
months
or
so
since
received
my
leg
leg
and
began
started
therapy
in
was
still
using
both
crutches
did
not
trust
my
leg
leg
at
all
and
had
a
terrible
limp
knee
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
able
to
fully
extend
because
of
the
contracture
that
had
been
present
for
so
long
occasionally
tried
to
leave
the
crutches
behind
but
always
felt
the
need
to
go
back
to
them
for
safety
and
stability
remember
my
therapist
telling
me
that
it
would
take
some
time
before
was
able
to
walk
unassisted
so
desperately
wanted
to
jump
ahead
and
be
walking
and
running
freely
but
knew
that
there
was
a
process
that
needed
to
go
through
first.\n
'
'\n
'
finally
ditched
the
crutches
about
a
month
after
starting
therapy
moved
to
a
cane
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
like
that
very
much
mostly
because
it
made
me
feel
too
old
used
the
cane
occasionally
but
tried
to
limp
around
without
it
still
had
some
strengthening
to
do
but
it
was
a
huge
step
to
leave
the
crutches
behind.\n
'
'\n
'
after
deciding
that
my
cane-using
days
were
over
began
walking
unassisted\xe2\x80\xa6all
the
time
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
very
big
into
that
idea
at
first
because
she
knew
that
still
had
some
weakness
that
we
needed
to
take
care
of
so
still
used
the
cane
in
our
sessions
noticed
that
my
trust
in
my
leg
leg
increased
and
my
limp
decreased.\n
'
'\n
'
only
have
a
slight
limp
that
most
people
probably
don\xe2\x80\x99t
notice
it
gets
worse
when
tired
or
in
pain
but
for
the
most
part
my
muscles
are
strong
and
my
body
is
stable
and
regained
almost
all
of
the
range
of
motion
in
my
knee
which
is
a
deal
able
to
walk
jog
hike
canoe
go
to
the
beach\xe2\x80\xa6basically
free
to
do
whatever
want
have
to
wait
a
few
months
before
can
talk
to
my
doctor
about
getting
a
running
leg
which
would
love
to
have
and
might
see
about
getting
a
swimming
leg
in
the
future
determined
to
enjoy
life
and
push
through
as
many
so-called
limits
as
possible

it

that

a
way
to

most

are
funny
and

than

(
from

a

it

are
numerous
causes
for
peoples\xe2\x80\x99
amputations
some
which
are
preventable
of
the
cause
with
so
many
people
becoming
amputees
daily
awareness
about
amputation
is
important.\n
'
'\n
'
is
awareness
important
first
of
all
many
people
do
not
know
how
to
react
to
amputees
tell
their
kids
not
to
stare
shy
away
from
the
subject
the
fact
that
someone
is
different
brings
up
questions
or
awkwardness
and
people
don\xe2\x80\x99t
know
how
what
to
do
that
am
on
the
other
side
of
things
realize
that
each
amputee
has
been
on
a
unique
journey
to
get
to
where
they
are
want
to
forget
that
it
ever
happened
while
others
are
completely
fine
with
their
amputation
way
amputees
should
be
treated
like
the
normal
human
beings
that
they
(
we
)
are
not
aliens
or
robots
just
because
we
may
have
metal
limbs
differences
don\xe2\x80\x99t
have
to
be
scary.\n
'
'\n
'
is
also
important
because
many
times
amputation
can
be
prevented
with
proper
care
only
given
one
body
while
we\xe2\x80\x99re
here
on
this
earth
so
it
is
critical
that
we
take
care
of
ourselves
positive
lifestyle
choices
can
help
avoid
health
problems
aware
of
changes
in
our
bodies
is
also
important
so
that
issues
can
be
resolved
before
they
spiral
out
of
control
me
for
example
would\xe2\x80\x99ve
gone
to
the
doctor
when
first
noticed
signs
of
my
limb
breaking
down
instead
of
waiting
until
things
became
irreversible
then
might
not
have
ended
up
where
am
today
fear
of
doctors
kept
me
from
seeking
help
but
now
know
that
the
right
doctors
will
do
anything
they
can
to
make
sure
their
patients\xe2\x80\x99
needs
are
taken
care
of.\n
'
'\n
'
am
a
proud
amputee
and
am
grateful
for
how
far
come
since
my
surgery
five
months
ago
hope
that
as
awareness
increases
my
fellow
amputees
will
realize
that
they
are
not
alone
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
have
to
mean
isolation
or
the
end
of
a
happy
fulfilling

also
hope
that
non-amputees
will
realize
that
amputees
are
just
like
anybody
else
and
there\xe2\x80\x99s
no
need
to
fear
what
you
don\xe2\x80\x99t

was
great
to

her

with

because
they
have
been
so
encouraging
to

both
before
and
after

watch
the
kids
every
week
and
they
were
a
big
reason
why
was
motivated
to
get
up
and
walk

to
be

get
to

my

about
getting
one
of

in
so
most
of
the
time
was
spent
walking
tried
to
jog
a
bit
but
think
it
looked
more
like

a

okay
though

had

of
an
acceptance
phase
when
realized
that
probably
wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t

said
never
walk
again
which
meant
that
running
was
far
out

never
right

you
become
an
amputee
you
are
basically
forced
to
interact
with
several
medical
professionals
the
obvious
people
who
are
there
when
your
surgery
first
happens
you
develop
a
team
of
people
who
have
different
roles
in
your

after

go

find

at
the

at

twice
a

get

chopped
my

off

was
in

multiple
times
per

to

a
wonderful

for

changes
my
visits
are
more
spread
out\xe2\x80\x93in
fact
the
next
time
see
him
won\xe2\x80\x99t
be
until
still
see
him
and
the
people
from
his
office
sometimes
when
roaming
around
the

but
that\xe2\x80\x99s
just
to
say
hello.\n
'

don\xe2\x80\x99t
see
this
doctor
much
but
he
is
the
one
who
signs
the
paperwork
when
ready
to
get
a
new
leg
see
him
at
once
every
few
months
chat
for
a
few
minutes
and
he
checks
my
leg
leg
out
to
make
sure
everything
is
going

in
technical
terms
prosthetist
spend
the
most

with
my

my
these

makes
adjustments
to
my
leg
leg
and
casts
me
for
new
sockets
when
needed
getting
my
leg
leg
laminated
in
a
few

so
it\xe2\x80\x99ll
look
better
than
it
does
right
now
mean
random
lines
and
circles
made
in
permanent

all
over
my
leg
leg
are
cool
and
all
but
looking
forward
to
my
new

\n
'

is
loads
of
fun
it
is
so
exciting
to
look
at
how
much
progress
made
each

see
my
twice
a
week
and
we
do
a
lot
of
strengthening
exercises
leg
press
resistance
bands
etc
among
other
things
are
currently
working
hard
to
get
rid
of
my
limp
which
means
my
muscles
need
to
get
stronger
met
most
of
my
goals
so
only
have
a
few
visits
left
still
have
to
do
my
exercises
at
home
but
won\xe2\x80\x99t
have
to
wake
up
early
for
appointments
anymore.\n

so
this
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
really
fit

you

would

thoughts
about
moving
to
a
new
country
and
packing
for
it
\r\n
enjoy
my
last
day
in
there
are
lots
of
thoughts
going
through
my
head
remember
the
first
time
moved
abroad
back
in
2005
as
a
college
student
actually
sobbed
to
my
mother
for
three
hours
more
recall
wailing
to
her
why
am
even
going
abroad
feel
comfortable
where
am
and
like
it
here
am
doing
years
later
eight
of
which
have
been
spent
outside
the
can
only
laugh
at
my
college
self
and
think
cute
honestly
wouldn\'t
change
the
last
nine
years
at
all.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
have
the
feeling
that
in
will
constantly
be
comparing
it
to
my
experience
realize
though
that
this
is
unfair
consistently
ranks
in
the
top
10
most
livable
cities
in
if
not
the
world
according
to
the
of
the
other
hand
ranks
as
the
number
one
country
for
expats
according
to
the
does
living
as
an
expat
actually
mean
a
good
quality
of
life
do
n't
think
it
necessarily
does
but
this
will
probably
be
one
of
the
bigger
questions
answer
in
'\r\n
'
thing
that
worries
me
about
living
in
is
being
but
my
is
only
so-so
course
'm
eager
to
improve
it
but
there
is
an
expectation
that
if
you
look
you
speak
the
local
language
's
a
common
problem
in
that
encountered
in
and
attitude
is
don\'t
you
speak
the
local
language

video
sums
up
my
experience
really
well

'\r\n

the

've
moved
abroad
for

going
to
once
with
my

managed
to
pack
one
suitcase
big
suitcase
that
weighs
19.6
kilograms
about
43
pounds
with
everything
think
need
in
it
've
realized
that
wear
the
same
stuff
over
and
over
again
anyway
so
if
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
should
pack
that
because
might
actually
wear
it

item
got
left
behind

what

it
comes
to
larger
trips
like
this
(
or
rather
just
moving
temporarily
take
a
look
at
what
want

bring

actually

it

actually
wind
up

do
take
that
into

is
too
specific

can\'t
be
combined
with
anything
else

get
packed
only
exception
is
a
cocktail

was
the
dead

\r\n
think
that
it
is
because
my
journey
of
being
a
bone
marrow
donor
\r\n
'and
helping
save
my
brother\xe2\x80\x99s
life
has
touched
me
so
deeply
and
had
such
an
impact
on
me
\r\n
experience
has
changed
my
perspective
on
life
so
much
so
that
had
to
give
it
some
time.\r\n
for
me
to
wrap
my
head
around
what
had
taken
place
and
what
my
brother
and
had
gone
through
\r\n
and
time
to
heal
not
only
physically

emotionally.\r\n
is
all
still
so
tender
and
my
feelings
are
so
close
to
the
surface
\r\n
'that
still
have
trouble
telling
the
story
without
crying
\r\n
'
mostly
happy
joyful
tears
\r\n
'
in
the
knowledge
that
we
have
a
who
loves
us
\r\n
'
'who
is
keenly
aware
of
each
and
everyone
of
us
and
the
trials
that
we
are
going
through.\r\n

is
an
that
posted
early
one
morning
on
our
drive
to
the
hospital.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
were
the
thoughts
that
came
to
my
mind
as
saw
the
beautiful
sunrise
that
morning
\r\n
did
know
that
the
words
that
wrote
that
morning
\r\n
'the
love
that
felt
that
my
had
for
me
and
my
brother
would
truly
be
what
held
on
to
\r\n
'and
what
kept
me
going
through
an
intense
time
during
this
journey
\r\n
'and
probably
one
of
the
scariest
moments
of
my
life
\r\n
'
this
experience
have
felt
our
love
as
if
arms
were
wrapped
around
me
\r\n
gave
me
the
strength
to
do
something
wonderful
something
remarkable\r\n
but
probably
one
of
the
hardest
things
that
ever
done
in
my
life
\r\n
'and
for
that
am
truly
humbled
and
ever
so
grateful
\r\n
'that
the
opportunity
to
be
my

donor

given
to
me

will
begin
the

me
by

almost
impossible

didn\xe2\x80\x99t

sense

had
just
turned
59

always
been
physically
fit

an
avid
hiker
who
swims
every
morning
for
an
hour
and
then
walks
at
lunchtime
for
another
hour
\r\n
is
the
perfect
picture
of
healthy
and
the
last
person
would
think
would
ever
have
cancer
\r\n
healthy
and
physically
fit

the
fact
that
they
caught
it
early
proved
to
be
a
blessing\r\n
so
as
hard
as
it
was
to
hear
that
he
had
cancer

felt
good
going
forward

he
begun
fighting
for
his

the
end

when
was
first
diagnosed

he
immediately

an
aggressive
series

treat

a
few
weeks

health
quickly
declined
he
was
experiencing
an
enormous
amount

pain

it
was
determined
that
he
would
need
a
bone

save
his
life

there
are
6
siblings
that
could
be
possible
candidates

one
if

of
us
would
be
a
\xe2\x80\x9cmatch.\xe2\x80\x9d
\r\n
of

the

came
back

not
one

was
still
waiting
for
my
kit

felt
anxious
about
the
situation
that
was
unfolding

so
sick

in
so
much
pain

things
looked
grim

birthday

my
brother
called
to
wish
me
a
happy
birthday

sounded
so
weak
that
hardly
recognized

to
be
upbeat

'but
told
me

he
didn\xe2\x80\x99t

could

on
long

to
find
a
match
from
the
national
registry

would
take
an
additional
6-8
weeks

was
shocked
to
her

so
discouraged

is
one
of
the
most
determined
hard
working
never
give
up

of
guys
that
ever
met

felt
so
much
pressure

was
determined
that
was
the
one
that
would
be
his
match

'\r\n
in
the
day
my
dear
friend
hosted
a
birthday
luncheon\r\n
with
a
few

included

yummy
birthday
cake.\r\n
it
was
time
to
blow
out

candle

of

so
desperately
needed.\r\n

as
it
scared
me
to
go
through
the
procedure
of
donating
my
bone
marrow
\r\n
'it
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
compare
to

'where
felt
the
placed
someone
specific
in
my
life
to
fulfill
a
particular
role
that
would
help
me
on
my
journey
\r\n
was
a
gentle
reminder
that
was
aware
of
exactly
what
was
going
through
\r\n
'and
felt
love
through
the
actions
of
so
many
friends
and
family
members\r\n
who
were
instrumental
though
out
the
donation
procedure.\r\n
'\r\n
first
signed
up
and
agreed
to
being
a
bone
marrow
donor
for
my
brother
\r\n
thought
it
would
entail
taking
bone
marrow
from
my
hip.\r\n
's
all
had
ever
heard
about
the
process
and
that
it
was
painful
\r\n
first
thoughts
were
\xe2\x80\x9cthis
is
going
to
hurt
but
have
survived
giving
birth
to
5
children
without
any
epidural
\r\n
'and
one
very
painful
emergency
so
can
handle
this
\xe2\x80\x9d
\r\n
kept
asking
me
if
had
talked
to
about
what
the
procedure
was
going
to
be
like
\r\n
'but
was
kind
of
in
denial
and
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
want
to
know
\r\n
figured
that
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
go
to
turn
back
now
so
what
good
was
it
going
to
do\r\n
to
hear
how
much
pain
was
going
to
have
to
endure
\r\n
thought
just
deal
with
it
when
it
comes.\xe2\x80\x9d
\r\n
got
online
and
found
out
that
most
bone
marrow
transplants
done
these
days
\r\n
'does
not
involve
taking
bone
marrow
from
your
hip
\r\n
'but
instead
there
was
a
new
process
where
bone
marrow
stems
cells
are
taken
from
your
blood
\r\n
'
sounded
so
much
easier
and
a
much
less
invasive
process
\r\n
was
excited
and
the
next
time
called
we
chatted
about
it
\r\n
'and
she
confirmed
that
this
was
indeed
the
procedure
that
would
do
\r\n
expressed
my
delight
upon
learning
this
and
she
responded
get
too
excited
\r\n
'although
it
is
a
simpler
procedure
it
is
no
walk
in
the
park
either
\xe2\x80\x9d
\r\n
words
rang
true
and
she
was
exactly
right
as
would
later
find
out
\r\n
'
still
at
that
time
it
gave
me
great
comfort
to
know
what
the
bone
marrow
transplant
procedure
was.\r\n
'
'
am
grateful
that
took
the
time
to
do
the
research
and
educate
me
about
what
about
to
go
through.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
next
few
weeks
were
busy
days
were
filled
with
scheduling
appointments
getting
blood
work
done
\r\n
'filling
out
pages
and
pages
of
medical
forms
medical
forms
faxing
them
back
to
\r\n
'only
to
find
out
that
she
never
received
them
so
had
to
do
it
all
over
again
\r\n
was
busy
making
travel
plans
booking
or
rebooking
flights\r\n
and
trying
to
get
things
done
at
home
so
that
could
be
able
to
leave
at
a
moments
notice
\r\n
had
a
couple
of
trips
already
booked
to
to
move
the
little
girls
out
of
their
summer
apartment
\r\n
'and
then
to
help
and
move
into
their
new
apartment
in
\r\n
would
have
cancelled
the
trips
if
they
needed
me
to
\r\n
'but
tried
to
schedule
my
appointments
in
around
them
\r\n
'\r\n
out
the
timing
was
more
difficult
than
thought
\r\n
'because
a
lot
revolved
around
my
brother\xe2\x80\x99s
chemo
and
how
he
reacted
to
the
treatment

tried
to
do
everything
that
needed
to
do
so
that
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
holding
things
up
and
was
ready
to
leave
to
go.\r\n
wanted
to
make
sure
that
did
everything
could
to
help
enable
us
to
move
forward
with
the
bone
marrow
donation.\r\n
knew
my
brother
was
in
so
much
pain
so
was
highly
motivated
to
make
sure
this
happened
\r\n
'\r\n
times
it
got
frustrating
hurrying
up
and
getting
things
done
on
my
end\r\n
and
then
waiting
and
waiting
to
hear
back
from
and
her
team
\r\n
'
were
made
and
then
get
a
call
and
things
had
changed
\r\n
was
the
case
when
packed
up
and
flew
to
at
the
beginning
of
\r\n
planned
on
flying
to
on
my
way
home
thinking
that
the
donation
procedure
would
take
place
at
that
time
\r\n
only
to
find
out
that
more
doctor
tests
were
scheduled
on
that
visit
\r\n
kind
of
took
me
for
a
loop
and
was
a
little
discouraged
when
they
rescheduled
the
donation
transplant
\r\n
'and
butted
it
up
right
against
a
trip
that
we
had
to
later
in
to
attend
the
\r\n
learned
that
needed
to
learn
to
be
patient
and
flexible\r\n
or
else
surely
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
going
to
make
it
through
this
process
\r\n
was
not
in
control
of
my
schedule
and
had
to
let
go
\r\n
'and
just
be
available
whenever
and
do
whatever
they
needed
be
to
do
\r\n
someone
who
is
a
planner
and
scheduler
this
was
a
hard
thing
to
give
up\r\n
but
am
proud
to
say
that
kind
of
surprised
myself
\r\n
'and
adapted
to
\xe2\x80\x9cjust
going
with
the
flow\xe2\x80\x9d
without
too
much
complaining.\r\n
'\r\n
mentioned
the
bone
marrow
donation
process
seemed
like
\r\n
'it
was
going
to
be
a
lot
easier
than
what
thought
had
originally
signed
up
for
\r\n
what
read
about
it
on
the
internet
it
was
simply
a
non-surgical
procedure
\r\n
'which
involved
being
given
injections
of
\r\n
'a
drug
that
would
stimulate
bone
marrow
stem
cells
for
5
days
leading
up
to
donation
\r\n
my
bone
marrow
stems
cells
would
take
place
over
a
two
day
time
period\r\n
in
which
blood
is
removed
through
a
needle
on
one
arm
\r\n
'and
passed
through
a
machine
that
separates
out
the
blood-forming
cells
\r\n
'
remaining
blood
is
returned
to
you
through
the
other
arm
easy
enough
right
\r\n
think
underestimated
what
was
about
to
take
on
and
was
a
little
over
confident
and
naive.\r\n
'\r\n
was
a
little
embarrassed
by
all
the
love
and
support
that
my
family
and
dear
friends
showered
upon
me

can\xe2\x80\x99t
even
begin

list
all
treats

goodies
left
on

the
cards
lovely
cards

notes

that
was
given.\r\n

for
my
first
round

appointments

this
is
what
my

looked
like
\r\n
felt
very
loved
and
was
very
aware
that
had
many

that
were
praying
for
me
\r\n
am
ever
so
grateful
those
prayers
really
do
have
the
best
friends
\r\n
was
also
grateful
to
the
beautiful

that
and
gave
me
which
gave
me
great
comfort
\r\n
did
know
that
those
prayers
and
that

would
carry
me
through
some
difficult
days
ahead.\r\n
'\r\n
spent
two
full
days
at
the
in
filled
with
doctor
appointments
\r\n
'including
a
full
check-up

of

was
drawn

had
to
fill
out

medical

filled
\r\n
'and
met
with
more
doctors

the
whole
process

what
to
expect

the
end

it

'
'\r\n
'
what
did
the
doctors
say
that
would
experience
during
this
process
\r\n
said
would
be
given
a
injection
of
the
drug
every
morning
for
5
days
\r\n
which
increases
the
production
of
bone
marrow
stem
cells
in
my
body
\r\n
was
told
the
drug
could
make
me
feel
achy
and
tired
possibly
nauseous
perhaps
experience
bad
headaches
\r\n
might
have
the
chills
or
feel
pain
in
my
bones
basically
any
flu-like
condition
is
a
possible
side
effect
from
the
drug

'
was
told
that
each
person
reacts
differently
to
the
drug

might
experience
one
all
or
none
of
these
side
effects
\r\n

can
handle

how
bad
can
it
be
be
sick
for
a
week
deal
\xe2\x80\x9d
\r\n
since
never
had
morning
sickness
or
the
stomach
flu
and
rarely
get
nauseous
\r\n
told
myself
that
was
just
going
to
think
positive
and
power
through
it
and
not
let
myself
get
sick
or
nauseous
\r\n
doctors
said
the
side
effects
from
the
drug
would
probably
be
the
worst
part
of
the
process
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
retrieval
would
take
place
over
a
two
day
period
following
the
5
days
of
injections
\r\n
morning
would
be
hooked
up
to
a
machine
that
would
draw
my
blood
\r\n
retrieving
the
stems
cells
needed
for
my
brother
and
then
return
my
blood
back
into
my
body
\r\n
'
was
given
two
choices
of
how
this
would
take
place
\r\n
'1
could
have
tubes
inserted
in
the
veins
of
both
of
my
arms
\r\n
'one
drawing
the
blood
which
would
be
filtered
through
a
machine
to
retrieve
the
bone
marrow
cells
\r\n
'and
then
the
blood
would
return
back
in
my
other
arm
or
\r\n
'2
could
have
a
pick
placed
in
my
neck
which
would
have
multiple
lines
to
retrieve
and
return
the
blood
\r\n
was
a
tough
decision
to
make
because
the
pick
was
more
invasive
\r\n
'but
would
make
it
easier
to
unhook
the
lines
and
gave
me
the
freedom
to
move
around
\r\n
'get
up
and
go
to
the
bathroom
or
just
stretch
and
that
seemed
like
such
a
good
idea
\r\n
'since
was
told
to
plan
on
being
at
the
hospital
6-8
hours
each
day
during
this
retrieval
process
\r\n
counselor
also
mentioned
that
might
feel
a
little
anxious
or
claustophobic
being
hooked
up
to
the
machine

'
'
those
things
in
mind
chose
the
pick

that
would
be
placed
in

neck

all
the
decisions
made
and
information
about
the
procedure
given
to
me
\r\n

flew
home
for
a
few
days
before
was
scheduled
to
come
back
to
start
the
whole
process.\r\n

both
volunteered
to
give
up
some
of
their
summer
vacation
to
take
care

a
few
fun
days
in

out

fun
things

up

with

up

awful

at

so
sick
from

whisked
off
to
a
surgery

have
my
pick
implanted

which
definitely
was
painful

think
because
had
mentally
prepared
for
it

seemed
to
handle
that
part
of
the
process
much
better
than
thought
would

the
one

to
include

felt
much
worse
when

on
\r\n

asked
the
nurse

change
back

a
dumb
thing

ugly

as
always

sharp

indeed

weird

something
sticking
out

my
neck

it
was
uncomfortable\r\n

had
been
warned
that
it
would
be
awkward

think
because
was
in
so
much
other
pain\r\n

so
nauseated

it

of

as

it

claustrophobic.\r\n

to
watch
an
episode

but
could

some
more

closed

were
great

held
my

rubbed
my
back

me

comfortable

'\r\n
one
point
my
brother
walked
all
the
way
from
his
room
to
visit
me
and
it
was
so
sweet
of
him.\r\n
had
to
do
was
take
one
look
at
him
and
was
reminded
that
whatever
pain
or
suffering
that
was
experiencing
\r\n
'was
nothing
compared
to
what
he
has
gone
through

just
needed
to
get
over
it

later
my
showed
up
to
be
with
me
during
the
day
and
help
me
pass
the
time.\r\n
'\r\n
felt
so
nauseous
and
agitated
at
that
moment
and
he
held
my
hand
and
comforted
me
\r\n
'the
way
that
only
a
loving
parent
can
and
felt
as
if
my
mom
was
there
with
us
watching
over
me

sweet
moments

support
from

so
much

rest
of
the
day
passed
by
with
only
one
episode
of
feeling
so
nauseous
and
claustrophobic
\r\n

'that
had
to
have
the
nurse
detach
all
the
pick
pick
lines

ran
to
the
bathroom.\r\n
'
'll
keep
the
rest
of
the
details
to
myself

was
so
glad
that
had
chosen

do
the
pick

had
the
option
to
get
up
out

needed
to.\r\n
do
n't

how
to
explain
exactly
how
you
feel

maybe
anxious
claustrophobic
and
high
strung
\r\n
after
throwing
some
water
on
my
face
and
taking
a
few
deep
breathes
\r\n
was
able
to
go
back
and
get
reattached
and
finish
up
that
afternoon
\r\n
really
made
a
difference
being
able
to
take
a
break
and
regroup
\r\n
the
time
my
nurse
said
that
they
were
finished
retrieving
my
bone
marrow
stems
cells
for
the
day

could
go
home

so
ready
to
leave
the
hospital

so
were
the
little
girls

soon
as
we
got
back
to
took
more
anti-nausea

pain
medicine

climbed
into
bed

were
so
happy
that
1
of
retrieval
was
done

one
more
day

would
be
finished

so
thought

my
last
day
of
injections
'm
happy

by
my
side

my
hand

taking
care

me

ready
for
what
should
have
been
a
pretty
uneventful
last
day
of
retrieval

little

made
sure
that
had
everything
that
needed
to
make
it
through
the
day

do
n't
know
who
was
more
excited
to
get
it
all
over
with
the
little
girls

me
\r\n
'\r\n
had
n't
been
there
too
long
when
came
in
to
check
on
me\r\n
and
informed
me
that
they
had
retrieved
1
million
bone
marrow
stems
from
me
the
first
day
\r\n
'
was
like
is
awesome
many
do
you
need
to
collect
\r\n
was
confused
because
was
thinking
that
a
million
is
a
dang
lot
and
was
doing
great
\r\n
but
the
look
on
her
face
was
of
great
concern
obviously
did
not
seem
to
share
my
enthusiasm
\r\n
turned
to
me
and
with
great
disappointment
in
her
voice
said
\r\n
ideally
we
would
like
to
gather
5
million
for
your
brother
\r\n
quickly
did
the
math
and
could
see
that
was
in
trouble
\r\n
was
told
beforehand
that
it
would
only
take
two
days
to
retrieve
the
stems
cells
\r\n
'
assured
me
that
only
2
%
ever
have
to
do
3
days
of
retrieval
this
rate
it
may
take
me
4
days
\r\n
burst
into
tears
was
so
discouraged
and
sad
\r\n
'partly
because
was
so
tired
and
sick
but
mostly
because
felt
so
responsible
\r\n
like
did
n't
do
my
part
or
like
it
was
somehow
my
fault
that
my
body\r\n
did
n't
produce
enough
stem
cells
fast
enough
for
retrieval
\r\n
was
n't
too
encouraging
but
she
did
hand
me
some
and
said
\r\n
don\'t
worry
we
will
see
how
today
goes
\r\n
'
yeah
you
might
was
to
change
your
flight
for
tomorrow
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
soon
as
she
left
the
room
the
little
girls
snuggled
up
on
either
side
of
my
bed
consoling
me
\r\n
'
were
all
exhausted
and
disappointed
and
within
minutes
we
all
feel
asleep
for
a
few
hours
\r\n
we
woke
up
immediately
got
on
the
phone
phone
to
to
change
my
flight
to
the
latest
flight
could
get
out
of
\r\n
was
hoping
that
could
come
in
earlier
than
usual
the
third
day
\r\n
'and
hopeful
they
could
collect
the
final
amount
without
a
hitch
\r\n
was
flying
in
the
next
morning
to
meet
up
with
me
\r\n
'so
switched
both
of
our
flights
out
of
to
the
very
last
flight
in
the
evening
\r\n
'\r\n
sat
on
hold
with
trying
to
rearrange
my
flight
felt
more
and
more
nauseous\r\n
and
noticed
that
my
body
was
starting
to
cramp
up
again
like
it
did
the
day
before
\r\n
time
it
was
ten
times
worse
and
no
matter
what
did
could
n't
shake
off
the
cramps.\r\n
was
like
my
whole
body
was
having
a
charlie
horse
cramp
and
had
no
control
over
what
my
body
was
doing
\r\n
was
in
so
much
pain
and
discomfort
so
told
the
technician
who
was
monitoring
the
machine
\r\n
'
acknowledged
that
did
n't
look
good
and
was
low
in
magnesium
but
hr
was
busy
collecting
the
blood
\r\n
my
nurse
finally
came
in
told
her
what
was
going
on
\r\n
and
she
acknowledged
that
my
magnesium
was
low
too
but
did
n't
offer
any
solution
\r\n
pulsating
feelings
in
my
body
were
out
of
control
\r\n
and
my
hands
begin
to
feel
as
if
they
were
paralyzed
and
could
n't
move
them
\r\n
couldn\'t
concentrate
and
it
got
so
bad
that
had
to
give
the
phone
phone
to
finish
rebooking
my
flight
with
\r\n
'
just
laid
there
in
pain
was
about
as
sick
as
've
ever
been
\r\n
technician
could
tell
that
it
was
really
bad
so
he
asked
if
wanted
to
finish
for
the
day
\r\n
'
of
me
really
wanted
to
but
was
so
concerned
about
the
stem
cell
count
being
so
low
that
said
that
would
go
on
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
the
hours
wore
on
it
got
worse
and
worse
knew
something
was
wrong\r\n
but
the
technician
and
my
nurse
did
n't
seem
too
concerned
\r\n
day
before
when
was
low
in
calcium
and
they
gave
me
a
calcium
drip
and
that
really
helped.\r\n
'm
not
really
sure
why
my
nurse
or
the
technician
did
n't
do
anything
about
the
low
magnesium
that
day\r\n
but
they
did
n't
so
just
laid
there
and
endured
the
pain
\r\n
'\r\n
1
pm
was
in
so
much
pain
that
had
had
enough
just
could
n't
take
it
anymore.\r\n
when
the
technician
again
asked
if
wanted
to
be
done
for
the
day
and
go
home
\r\n
was
just
about
ready
to
take
him
up
on
his
offer
\r\n
then
one
of
my
oldest
and
dearest
friends
called
\r\n
'and
said
that
she
was
coming
over
to
visit
in
a
few
minutes
\r\n
'
decided
to
wait
because
did
n't
want
to
miss
who
arrived
about
20
minutes
later
\r\n
tried
to
pull
myself
together
so
that
would
n't
suspect
anything
\r\n
did
n't
want
her
to
know
how
sick
was
and
cause
her
any
concern
\r\n
'but
as
the
minutes
went
on
it
became
harder
and
harder
\r\n
'
was
adorable
and
brought
me
a
basket
huge
basket
of
all
of
my
favorite
treats
which
was
so
sweet
of
her
\r\n
was
cheerful
and
sweet
with
the
girls
but
as
time
went
on
\r\n
finally
could
n't
take
it
any
long
and
told
the
technician
that
was
done
\r\n
sent
down
to
get
the
car
and
told
to
pack
me
up
for
the
day
\r\n
'
the
sudden
got
so
incredibly
nauseous
that
did
n't
even
have
time
to
ask
them
to
unhook
me
from
the
machine
\r\n
nurse
could
see
it
coming
and
gave
me
a
bag
just
in
time
for
me
to
throw
up
into
it
not
once
but
three
times
\r\n
felt
out
of
control
and
just
like
that
it
through
my
whole
body
into
a
tailspin.\r\n
sat
back
and
the
next
few
minutes
are
kind
of
a
blur
\r\n
hands
were
completely
frozen
in
a
strange
claw-like
position
\r\n
'along
with
the
rest
of
my
body
completely
cramping
up
and
felt
like
was
having
a
seizure
or
a
stroke
\r\n
'
just
wanted
to
get
unhooked
from
the
machine
and
felt
that
would
make
me
feel
better
and
fix
everything
\r\n
tried
to
stay
calm
as
was
packing
me
up
and
the
tech
unhooked
the
lines.\r\n
asked
if
she
could
put
my
shoes
shoes
on
because
couldn\'t
move
my
hands
\r\n
came
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
knelt
down
to
grab
my
shoes
shoes
\r\n
'but
she
took
one
look
at
my
feet
which
were
also
in
an
awkward
muscle
spasm
state
and
looked
up
at
me
\r\n
'and
with
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
said
don\'t
think
you
should
go
home.\r\n
is
very
wrong
and
think
you
better
get
back
in
that
bed

'
knew
she
was
right
she
picked
me
up
and
put
me
back
into
bed
\r\n
'\r\n
laid
there
looking
up
at
who
had
a
look
of
fear
on
her
face\r\n
and
wanted
to
cry
but
did
n't
want
to
scare
her.\r\n
knew
that
was
in
bad
shape
really
bad
had
no
control
over
my
body

felt
like
was
having
a
stroke
and
my
words
were
slurred
when
spoke.\r\n

is
this
happening
to
me
\r\n
'
could
something
bad
happen
to
me
when
was
trying
to
do
something
good

thought
bad
things
happen
to
good
people

knew
that
there
were
risks
even
though
they
are
extremely
rare
\r\n
had
been
warned
that
one
of
the
things
that
could
potentially
go
wrong
would
be
a
stroke
or
heart
attack

'
braced
myself
and
at
that
moment
turned
everything
over
to
the
\r\n
'\r\n
laid
there
helplessly
looking
at
for
comfort

to
be
strong
for
her
\r\n

put
my
trust
in
the
that
all
would
be
well

thought
of
the
beautiful
priesthood
blessing
that
and
had
given
me
\r\n
'before
left
home

that
gave
me
great
comfort

honestly
did
n't
know
what
was
happening

it
was
all
going
to
turn
out
but
felt
at
peace
\r\n
watched
as
was
frantically
texting
and
checking
the
monitor
on
the
machine
\r\n
soon
as
got
the
information
about
my
levels
she
told
to
run
and
get
my
doctor
\r\n
goodness
have
daughters
who
are
on
top
of
things
\r\n
was
gone
getting
help
stayed
and
comforted
me
\r\n
and
within
minutes
my
nurse
appeared
along
with
a
nurse
practitioner
\r\n
a
guy
with
an
machine
and
others
who
began
working
on
me
trying
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
\r\n
still
had
my
pick
pick
in
so
they
were
able
to
quickly
draw
vials
of
blood\r\n
and
an
was
done
they
were
trying
to
assess
if
it
was
a
heart
attack.\r\n
did
n't
think
so
really
thought
was
having
a
stroke
\r\n
'\r\n
could
n't
even
communicate
at
that
moment
and
by
the
look
on
's
face
\r\n
knew
that
she
was
terrified
for
me
and
was
so
scared
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
me
too.\r\n
grateful
was
that
was
there
to
comfort
\r\n
kept
thinking
that
if
something
did
happen
which
would
be
horrible
for
to
witness
\r\n
but
at
least
would
be
there
to
comfort
her
and
could
n't
think
of
anyone
that
would
do
a
better
job
then
\r\n
that
moment
it
gave
me
great
peace
of
mind
knowing
that
and
it
helped
me
stay
calm
\r\n
'
was
another
tender
mercy
knew
it
was
n't
just
a
coincidence
that
she
came
to
visit
right
at
that
time.\r\n
knew
that
she
could
help
me
through
this
crisis
and
if
it
were
n't
for
her
visit
\r\n
would
have
left
the
hospital
and
would
n't
have
been
able
to
get
the
immediate
help
that
needed.\r\n
'm
so
very
grateful
to
for
being
there
for
me
when
needed
her
the
most.\r\n
'\r\n
'
later
my
doctor
ran
in
had
tracked
her
down
in
the
hospital\r\n
and
told
her
what
was
going
on
and
she
came
running
\r\n
explained
that
my
magnesium
level
had
plummented
something
that
she
said
she
has
never
seen
before
\r\n
was
the
cause
of
my
muscle
cramps/spasms
that
was
experiencing
\r\n
'but
the
main
concern
was
that
it
could
cause
a
heart
attack
thus
the
reason
for
the
\r\n
'
informed
me
that
they
were
starting
me
on
a
magnesium
drip
which
would
take
4
hours
\r\n
left
for
about
15-20
minutes
while
they
set
up
the
drip
\r\n
and
returned
to
inform
me
that
she
had
met
with
's
team
of
doctors\r\n
and
they
had
determined
that
was
not
to
continue
the
process
any
longer
\r\n
even
though
was
scheduled
for
a
third
day
of
retrieval
\r\n
told
her
that
was
now
and
that
rebooked
my
flight
and
was
fine
about
staying
another
day
\r\n
begged
her
to
let
me
complete
the
donation
\r\n
knew
that
the
number
of
stem
cells
that
they
had
retrieved
was
low
\r\n
and
was
worried
that
they
did
n't
have
enough
for
my
brother
's
transplant.\r\n
felt
like
had
come
this
far
and
just
wanted
to
finish
the
job
\r\n
said
that
they
had
retrieved
a
much
higher
amount
of
stem
cells
the
second
day\r\n
'and
she
tried
to
convince
me
that
they
thought
they
had
just
enough
for
the
transplant
to
be
successful
\r\n
still
pleaded
with
her
and
promised
that
would
n't
let
this
happen
again
\r\n
like
had
much
control
over
my
low
magnesium
level
)
\r\n
'
wouldn\'t
budge
and
finally
said
we
aren\'t
going
to
risk
losing
you
in
order
to
save
your
brother
\r\n
'
guess
what
just
happened
to
me
was
pretty
serious
\r\n
'\r\n
this
time
we
remembered
that
was
waiting
downstairs
in
the
car
car
\r\n
so
we
told
her
to
go
park
the
car
car
and
come
back
up
was
such
a
doll
for
staying
as
long
as
she
did
\r\n
'but
now
that
felt
like
was
out
of
the
woods
insisted
that
she
get
back
to
her
family
\r\n
'
could
n't
thank
her
enough
for
being
there
for
me
like
she
has
so
many
times
in
my
life.\r\n
'\r\n
'
were
all
pretty
bummed
about
having
to
stay
at
the
hospital
for
4
more
hours
\r\n
started
my
magnesium
drip
and
although
was
excited
to
get
that
going
\r\n
'because
knew
that
it
would
help
with
my
muscle
spasms\r\n
and
relieve
my
body
of
the
paralyzed
state
that
it
was
in
knew
that
it
was
going
to
be
miserable
\r\n
dear
friend
has
to
get
a
magnesium
drip
after
giving
birth
to
each
of
her
children.\r\n
remember
her
telling
me
how
miserable
it
is
she
was
right
\r\n
'
the
muscle
cramps
and
spasms
ended
experienced
a
burning/scratching
feeling
as
the
drip
entered
my
body
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
15
minutes
after
the
drip
started
in
walked
our
dear
friends
and
\r\n
'
ca
n't
tell
you
how
happy
we
were
to
see
them
girls
were
exhausted
emotionally
and
physically
\r\n
and
just
needed
an
extra
hug
which
could
n't
really
provide
right
then
\r\n
and
had
been
the
best
little
caretakers
all
week
\r\n
'and
then
watching
me
go
through
such
trauma
was
just
about
all
they
could
endure
\r\n
'
's
come
right
when
they
did
was
another
sweet
tender
mercy
\r\n
had
no
idea
what
had
just
happened
so
when
they
saw
me
almost
started
crying
\r\n
'
girls
just
fell
into
their
arms
and
we
all
shed
a
few
tears
were
happy
tears
\r\n
'
have
such
wonderful
people
in
my
life
showed
up
exactly
when
needed
them
to
was
truly
another
tender
mercy
\r\n
a
blessing
that
will
ever
be
grateful
to
them
for
comforting
the
little
girls
when
they
needed
a
little
love.\r\n
next
4
hours
flew
by
as
we
chatted
and
visited
with
and
\r\n
'
are
the
best
friends
and
my
girls
adore
them\r\n
'
'
so
it
was
such
a
fun
treat
and
perfect
way
to
end
such
a
emotional
and
stressful
day
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
we
were
hanging
out
with
the
's
my
brother
was
receiving
my
stem
cells
which
contained
my
bone
marrow
\r\n
call
that
moment
a
new
birthday
for
my
brother
because
it
is
a
new
chance
on
life
\r\n
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
celebrate
and
be
with
him
when
they
give
him
the
blood
transfusion
and
take
a
few
pictures
\r\n
'
really
wanted
to
share
that
moment
with
him
but
then
it
was
just
a
little
chaotic
that
afternoon
\r\n
'
and
at
some
point
just
told
to
run
the
party
stuff
up
to
's
room
and
wish
him
well.\r\n
'\r\n
'
the
drip
was
done
my
nurse
came
in
to
remove
my
pick
pick
\r\n
'
had
to
include
this
photo
photo
of
what
the
pick
looked
like
'm
sorry
know
it\
's
gross.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
thought
she
would
give
me
some
anesthesia
or
something
but
she
just
clipped
the
stitches
and
pulled
this
tube
out
of
my
neck
\r\n
'
was
the
strangest
thing
to
feel
it
coming
out
of
your
body
you
can
see
was
trying
to
be
brave
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
tube
that
would
draw
the
blood
out
of
my
body
for
getting
this
shot
of
it
and
documenting
everything
for
me.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
done
had
a
large
whole
in
my
neck
but
just
had
to
hold
this
gauze
pad
and
apply
pressure
and
was
good
to
go.\r\n
'\r\n
next
day
arrived
at
the
hospital
early
to
run
through
the
last
few
tests
\r\n
'to
decide
if
was
healthy
enough
to
get
cleared
to
travel
that
day
\r\n
'
was
thrilled
that
every
test
came
back
with
good
results
and
was
able
to
leave
the
hospital
\r\n
stopping
by
's
room
and
visiting
with
him
and
his
wife
walked
out
of
the
hospital
for
the
last
time.\r\n
were
in
good
spirits
and
very
sweet
and
appreciative
of
my
stem
cell
donation.\r\n
we
just
had
to
wait
and
see
if
his
body
was
going
to
accept
the
donation.\r\n
was
the
hard
part
to
leave
not
knowing
if
the
transplant
was
going
to
work
or
not.\r\n
my
brother
that
day
was
hard
and
all
could
do
was
hope
and
pray
that
it
would
be
a
success
\r\n
'
walked
out
of
the
hospital
and
had
to
take
a
picture
\r\n
'
'
wanted
to
do
a
jumping
one
but
after
one
futile
attempt
to
jump
\r\n
'
'
neither
had
the
energy
nor
balance
so
and
decided
this
pose
was
good
enough
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
took
this
picture
of
one
of
the
beautiful
flowers
outside
the
hospital.\r\n
'
love
it
because
it
represents
the
's
beauty
and
love
that
we
felt\r\n
at
the
conclusion
of
what
was
one
of
the
most
incredible
and
difficult
things
that
've
ever
done
in
my
life
\r\n
know
that
lives
that
loves
me
and
my
brother
and
everyone
of
us
\r\n
'
most
of
all
that
is
aware
of
all
that
we
are
going
through
and
will
never
leave
us
\r\n
'
is
always
with
us
'm
ever
so
grateful
for
this
blessing
in
my
life.\r\n
'\r\n
'
one
might
ask
would
you
do
it
all
over
again
\r\n
at
that
moment
probably
would
have
hesitated
but
said
\r\n
'
hard
as
it
was
ca
n't
even
explain
how
incredible
it
feels
to
know
that
helped
save
a
life.\r\n
words
can
describe
that
feeling
and
am
humbled
and
feel
very
honored\r\n
'
'
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
give
someone
a
second
chance
on
life.\r\n
'
that
time
has
passed
and
have
completely
healed
would
answer
enthusiastically
\r\n
brother
celebrated
the
100
day
milestone
last
month.\r\n
body
has
accepted
my
stem
cells
and
my
bone
marrow
has
replaced
his.\r\n
has
not
shown
any
indication
of
graft
versus
host
disease
\r\n
'which
means
he
has
had
no
rejection
of
the
stem
cell
transplant.\r\n
is
tapering
off
the
anti-rejection
meds
and
if
all
goes
well
within
9
months
he
will
be
done
with
them.\r\n
show
that
96
%
of
his
bone
marrow
is
now
being
produced
by
my
stem
cells.\r\n
another
amazing
part
is
that
his
blood
type
will
change
to
mine
n't
that
crazy
\r\n
medicine
is
just
amazing
and
am
so
grateful
for
it
\r\n
'and
so
very
grateful
for
the
miracles
in
my
life
but
most
of
all
right
now
\r\n
am
grateful
to
have
played
a
small
role
in
this
miracle
in
my
brother
's
life

'\r\n
life
of
a
new
has
been
in
our
lives
for
3
weeks
now
is
hard
to
remember
what
life
consisted
of
before
the
nightly
feedings
and
constant
diaper
duties
like
have
been
brainwashed
to
forget
all
those
days
of
luxury
naps
and
carrying
a
purse
purse
instead
of
a
diaper
bag
diaper
bag
love
being
a
though
(
even
more
when
she\
's
napping
in
my
arms
and
wouldn\'t
change
it
for
the
world
what
our
days
consist
of
since
becoming
and
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
and
not
enough
really
took
the
advice
sleep
when
they
are
sleeping
seriously
has
been
my
favorite
activity
just
don\'t
want
her
to
nap
alone
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
and
burping-
one
tells
you
that
your
new
occupation
is
going
to
feel
like
you
're
the
local
watering
hole
time
in
between
feedings
goes
by
so
fast
sometimes
feel
like
she
is
glued
to
my
boob
for
a
good
portion
of
the
day
is
a
great
burping
buddy
and
takes
over
that
duty
with
total
dedication
\r\n
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
went
to
church
for
the
first
time
and
everyone
was
very
excited
to
see
the
newest
member
of
the
congregation
were
told
that
we
came
back
to
church
too
early
but
and
needed
to
get
some
social
interaction
with
people
who
we
did
n't
talk
baby
to
all
day
(
yes
thats
a
language
)

so
many
a
new
parent
am
convinced
you
believe
everything
your
little
one
does
is
the
cutest
thing
that
has
ever
been
done

took
a
picture
picture
of
her
really
big
poop
blowout
the
other
day
really
felt
like
a
at
that
moment
try
and
send
a
picture
picture
of
everyday
so
he
feels
more
included
in
our
happenings
while
at
work
was
the
first
day
he
went
back
to
work
told
me
what
to
write

bright

the

down
into
the
carrier

to
get
a
glimpse
of

toting
around

came
back
from
a
road
trip

have
named

but
didn\'t
apologize
for
the
length
wanted
to
fit
the
entire
trip
into
this
one
post
.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
decided
it
was
time
to
load
the
kids
up
and
head
out
for
beautiful
made
a
full
circle
leaving
and
heading
to
for
the
night
then
cutting
through
until
we
arrived
in
we
came
home
home
we
went
through
and
then
down
through
and
until
we
were
back
to
legs
of
the
trip
took
about
15
hours
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
was
your
typical
road
trip
there
was
scenery
lots
of
yummy
food
a
little
puking
some
site
seeing
car
car
sickness
and
a
car
fender
bender

we
did
it

a
side
note
this
will
come
into
play
at
the
end
of
the
trip
back
on
5
the
kids
and
were
in
a
car
car
accident
that
totaled
my
car
car
my
car
car
was
only
a
year
old
wanted
to
replace
it
with
the
exact
same
car
but
there
is
a
huge
waiting
list
for
this
car
now
so
was
told
by
every
dealership
that
would
take
4
months
to
replace
my
car
car
and
chose
to
wait
it
out
first
two
months
of
the
summer
drove
's
wrapped
car
that
has
his
face
all
over
it
lucky
me
and
then
the
last
two
months
the
dealership
was
able
to
provide
me
with
a
loaner
car

good
in

car
did
a
post
here
about
traveling
in
the

with

but
really
think
it
just
takes
a
lot
of
practice

this
most
of
the
way

so
bored

desperate
on
the

that
we
stopped
for
and
remembered
that
the

almost
9
years

cow
in
the
middle
of
the
road
luckily
my
hubby
grew
up
on
a
working
farm
with
cattle

he
knew

dinner
at
a
brewery
the
kids
played
and
played
by
the
water
a
bad
view.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
said
we
should
eat
at
a
la
this
outdoor
crepe
stand
but
it
started
raining
really
hard
so
stood
in
the
rain
to
get
our
crepes
and
we
ate
them
in
the
car
car
these
crepes
were
the
best
've
ever
had
and
'm
pretty
much
a
crepe
eating
expert
ended
up
having
them
3
nights
in
a
row
for
dessert
sooooo
good
\r\n

'\r\n

'\r\n

kiddos
said
they
were
still
hungry
after
dinner
and
crepes
and
they
wanted
a
pizza
note
the
gets
do
n't
eat
much
can
pretty
much
eat
two
bites
and
call
it
good
until
the
next
day
just
never
have
been
big
eaters
and
they
do
n't
snack
between
meals
so
when
they
said
they
were
hungry
and
wanted
more
to
eat
we
happily
got
them
a
little
pizza
to
share.\r\n
'\r\n
'
mistake.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
.we
were
staying
in
the
which
was
okay
but
not
fabulous
)
and
they
upgraded
us
to
a
suite
with
a
separate
bedroom
the
only
catch
is
that
there
was
only
one
king
sized
bed
so
we
decided
that
was
fine
and
we
would
all
four
sleep
together
forward
to
this
evening
and
around
10:30
threw
up
everywhere
the
bed
we
were
all
sleeping
by
everywhere
mean
e.v.e.r.y.w.h.e.r.e.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'
'\r\n
'
're
pretty
sure
it
was
a
mixture
of
too
much
pizza
and
altitude
sickness
soon
as
it
was
over
she
was
good
to
go
slept
through
the
entire
ordeal
literally
picked
him
up
and
moved
him
around
to
clean
up
and
remove
all
the
bedding
and
he
never
even
opened
an
eyelid

first

not
be
until
the
23rd
but
decided
to
finally
be
early
on
something
and
get
my
mantel
mantel
looking
a
little
more
fall-ish
especially
since
it
was
still
decorated
in

spring
decor
it
was
a
mixture
of
spring
and
summer
that
is
no
excuse
it
looked
not-put-together
and
was
in
need
of
serious
attention
took
5
minutes
to
make
it
presentable.\r\n

'
didn\'t
want
to
go
with
traditional
fall
colors
pumpkins
or
leaves
did
the
traditional
fall
decor
last
year
so
thought
a
change
was
needed
year
went
with
a
neutral
color
palette
with
touches

warm
rustic
colors

what
managed

rummage
from

decor
is
simple
which
is
a
change
for
me
really
play
it
up
with
lots
of
colors
and
elements
but
really
like
the
changes
the

staked
some
books

topped
them
with

have
just
been
living
life
and
blogging
a
little
when
a
friend
told
me
that
should
sign
up
for
a
booth
at
which
did
of
madness
worked
and
worked
(
and
recruited
my
parents
to
work
and
work
to
get
ready
had
no
clue
who
would
come
what
would
happen
or
if
would
even
have
anyone
enter
my
booth
booth
was
no
turning
back
though
paid
my
booth
fee
and
was
testing
the
waters
a
little
deeper
with
an
actual
booth
not
just
pictures
pictures
online.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
you
know
what
booth
was
a
hit
loved
the
items
said
the
booth
was
the
must
see
and
continually
asked
where
my
store
front
was
you
catch
that
.where
is
my
store
was
over
the
moon
because
actually
hearing
the
words
from
complete
strangers
gave
me
a
huge
leap
towards
my
dream
not
just
a
step
huge
leap
is
confidence
know
that
can
do
this.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
continue
along
the
path
now
have
a
website
website
for
bonafide
grown-up
.com
website
website
www.lavishyou.com
site
has
information
about
furniture
rehabs
and
e-decorating
but
still
needs
a
lot
of
work
(
is
brand
new
cut
me
a
little
slack
)
plan
is
to
modify
the
site
to
fit
my
*hopefully*
ever-growing
business
and
one-day
store
front
would
be
so
happy
if
you
would
hop
on
over
to
and
take
a
look
around
let
me
know
what
you
think
be
it
good
or
bad.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
does
the
future
hold
have
no
idea
do
know
that
there
will
be
some
major
life
changing
decisions
and
moments
in
the
year
to
come
am
going
to
continue
walking
down
the
dream
path
side-by-side
with
my
family
and
see
where
it
takes
us.\r\n

couponing
while
pregnant
with
my

wanted
to
get
rid
of
my
husband\
's
credit
debt
and
save
a
little
we
decided
should
stay
home
home
after
started
having
medical
problems
couponing
helped
us
live
within
our
means
ethical
couponing
makes
that
easier

met
many
couponers
that
are
awesome

down
to

we
found
tomato
paste
cans
for
15\xc2\xa2
a
can
when
a
grocery
store
was
clearing
out
a
buy
we
bought
50
of
them
for
7.50
but
guess
what
we
used
all
50
well
before
the
expiration
dates
paste
makes
speghetti
sauce
pizza
sauce
chili
soup
base
anything
that
requires
a
tomato
base
of
some
sort
you
can
make
from
tomato
paste
yeah
we
stock
piled
them
cans
were
dated
out
more
then
a
year
for
expiration
so
we
just
had
to
use
one
a
week
to
use
them
all
by
the
time
they
expired
an
issue
at
all
and
we
saved
a
bundle
not
buying
pizza
sauce
spehgetti
sauce
tomato
juice
etc
for
recipes.\r\n
'\r\n
we
got
a
bunch
of
manufacturer

coupons
for
75\xc2\xa2
off

in
the
packaging
with
our
toothbrushes
electric
toothbrushes
it
was
a
fold
out
of
ten
coupons
in
each
package
it
was
an
awesome
\'thank
you
for
buying
our
toothbrush\
and
then
found
a
store
sale
of
the
same
toothpaste
2
for
1.50
bought
20
did
some
figuring
to
see
what
we
could
use
before
they
expired
and
sent
the
rest
off
as
part
of
a
care
package
to
a
shelter
'd
heard
through
word
of
mouth
was
really
struggling
to
be
able
to
afford
personal
care
items
for
those
it
helped
'm
still
not
sure
my
's
forgiven
me
and
for
clearing
him
out
of
those
travel
shampoos
and

he
stockpiles
when
we
made

box
up

3
a

for
ones
that
are
normally
10+

had
from

even
baby
product

sent
the

in

buy
subscriptions
subscriptions
just
for
the
coupons
yes
do
what
is
happy
magazines
get
money
for
their

manufacturers
get
someone
who
wants
to
see
their
ads
and
if
a
product
we
try
is
really
good-
my
husband
and
are
both
the
types
that
we
tell
people
about
it-
so
manufacturers
are
happy
again
for
more
word
of
mouth
stores
get
something
that
is
just
as
good
as
legal
tender
to
them
and
get
a
deal.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
traded
sold
or
bought
coupons
are
legal
ways
to
do
this
a
coupon
does
n't
say
non
transferrable
or
not
valid
if
sold
transfered
etc
then
it
's
not
an
issue
have
n't
couponed
much
after
having
my
youngest
and
am
just
thinking
about
starting
again
imagine
that
there
's
been
a
bit
of
a
backlash
form
and
bet
more
say
this
now
of
now
have
n't
even
looked
into
finding
trading
circles
for
buying
them
from
it
can
be
cost
effective
if
it
's
an
item
you
know
you
will
buy
and
you
figure
in
the
cost
of
buying
the
coupons
towards
the
amount
saved
generally
tried
to
make
sure
that
sold
enough
to
cover
what
spent
buying
others
basically
made
it
just
another
form
of
trading
currently
do
n't
even
have
a
account
the
third
time
they
locked
the
account
up
because
someone
somewhere
tried
to
hack
into
it
a
couple
years
ago
never
reinstated
it
did
n't
feel
safe
anymore.\r\n
'\r\n
'
as
much
as
dislike
care
even
less
for
store
managers
or
cashiers
that
give
couponers
a
hard
time
've
worked
for
a
grocery
store
in
just
about
any
position
you
can
imagine
and
several
you
probably
have
never
considered
know
what
'm
talking
about
on
this
is
just
bad
business
practice
to
hassel
a
couponer
that
is
using
coupons
in
a
valid
way
'too
many
coupons
or
'being
a
habitual
coupon
user
is
not
an
invalid
way
unless
the
coupons
actually
state
a
specific
limit
the
couponer
is
ignoring
remember
a
story
this
summer
about
a
couponer
being
refused
by
a
store
manager
because
she
was
a
'habitual
coupon
user
'
just
ridiculous.\r\n
'\r\n
'
coupons
are
like
legal
tender
to
the
store
the
cashier
a
coupon
for
1.00
off
is
just
like
giving
the
cashier
a
one
dollar
bill
them
with
store
coupons
is
no
different
to
the
store
then
using
the
store
coupon
alone-
and
stores
want
them
to
use
that
coupon
because
it
gets
them
in
to
the
store
to
spend
money
should
the
store
care
if
the
money
is
the
manufacture
's
through
coupons
or
the
shopper
's
from
their
pocket
or
a
mix
of
both
experience
is
the
managers
that
have
issues
with
coupons
do
n't
understand
the
premiss
of
how
the
coupons
work
for
the
store
took
care
of
that
situation
at
least
should
understand
how
bad
it
is
for
the
bottom
line
of
a
store
to
refuse
money

we
have
trepidations
about
leaving
our
children
jettisoning
everything
and
moving
to
for
a
year
without
a
home
car
or
jobs
a
doubt
we
fearful
about
living
out
of
a
couple
of
suitcases

being
blissfully
unaware
of
some
of
the
difficulties
we
would
encounter
and
making
up
our
itinerary
as
we
went
along
was
perhaps
the
most
terrifying
thing
we\xe2\x80\x99d
ever
done
but
we
knew
it
felt
right
and
that
if
we\xe2\x80\x99d
given
in
to
fears
backed
down
and

not

go
we

have

it

the

organically
on

be
able
to
take
advantage

possibilities

to
change
our
plans

how

a
skeletal
framework
a
tentative
list

the
fact
that
we

we

where
we

in

ticked

\r\n

on

road
was
not
always
glamorous
does
indeed
have
its
difficulties
there
were
days
of
skinned
knees
both
literal
and
figurative
on
the
cobbled
streets
of

our
journey
the
answer
to
our
long-standing
dream
of
living
in

it
deep
in

is
yes
it
was
all
we

and
more.\r\n

is
life
with
the
boring
bits
left
out
was
observation
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
glorification
of
long-term
travel
from
the
sidelines
it
appears
to
be
kaleidoscopic
sophisticated
and
always
in
every
minute
of
every
day
the
reality
is
that
much
of
an
extended
journey
is
just
life
after
all
filled
with
daily
habits
and
the
ordinary
tasks
of
living
are
ups
and
downs
excitement
and
ennui
and
yes
indeed
there
are
those
tedious
boring
bits.\r\n

unveiling
of
the
aftermath
of
our
of
our
reassimilation
into
what
would

about

begin

for

what

could
to
make
our

in

as
long
as
possible
\xe2\x80\x93
at

in

appreciating
every
minute
and

the
inexorable
flow
of
time

stanch
seemed

forever
and

only
yesterday
that
we
had
landed
in
12
months
earlier.\r\n
'

'
the
final
time
in
what
had
become
my
travel
day
ritual
slipped
on
my
uniform
of
comfort
my
jeans
final
boyfriend
jeans
final
black
tee
and
sandals
final
hiking
sandals
and
we
whispered
goodbye
to
our
studio
and
took
to
the
road
bags
dragging
behind
us
we
walked
past
performing
the
early
morning
rituals
of
brasserie
sweeping
and
bistro

up

window
polishing
plat
du

posting
and
unstacking
and
hosing
down
the
plastic-webbed
chairs
of
sidewalk
cafes
walked
by
our
favorite
little
neighborhood
boulangerie
and
despite
the
urge
to
pause
resisted
the
buttery
yeasty
smell
of
fresh
croissants
and
baguettes
wafting
into
the
street
at
the
airport
was
going
to
have
to
do.\r\n

we
rolled
up
the
final
escalator
to
the
metro
platform
serenaded
by
a
busker
on
an
accordion
down
below
it
hit
me
like
an
arrow
from
a
tightly
strung
bow
we
were
leaving
saying
goodbye
to
and
our
adventure
had
come
to
a
close

a
fitting
morning
elegy
for
the
end
of
our
filled
with
lament
as
overflowed
with
emotion
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
cross-examined
ourselves
daily
over
the
previous
12
months
about
whether
taking
a
was
testament
to
our
madness
a
tribute
to
our
pluck
or
just
a
step
in
our
lives
that
seemed
so
right
for
the
time
answer
is
likely
an
amalgam
of
all
three
whatever
the
answer
what
we
could
attest
to
was
feeling
lucky
to
have
had
our
dream
come
true
to
have
been
able
to
take
a
year
off
from
regular
life
fortunate
to
have
had
calm
waters
at
home
such
that
we
were
able
to
take
a
sabbatical
without
interruption
ran
almost
maniacally
from
the
logic
characteristic
of
some
self-satisfied
individuals
of
privilege
that
because
they\xe2\x80\x99ve
been
blessed
they
believe
they
deserve
it
simply
felt
lucky
fortunate
and
happy
that
our
madness
and
our
pluck
had
brought
us
there.\r\n

'
recalled
the
newly
married
couple
we\xe2\x80\x99d
met
in
who
innocently
sought
our
advice
two
weeks
\xe2\x80\x9d
they
asked
\xe2\x80\x9cenough
time
to
see
\xe2\x80\x9d
my
we
replied
be
here
for
a
year
and
we
still
won\xe2\x80\x99t
see
it
all
barely
have
scratched
the
surface.\xe2\x80\x9d
353

countries
11
capital
cities
and
countless
trains
planes
busses
shuttles
rental
cars
cable
cars
gondolas
ships
and
ferries
there
was
still
so
much
more
to
see.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
our
plane
lifted
off
from
and
soared
upward
the
individual
sights
of
and
its
suburbs
quickly
blended
into
the
mosaic
of
rural
below
was
a
gentle
palette
of
perfectly
outlined

\xe2\x80\x93
the

were

vividly
recall
holding
my
hand
leaning
over
to
me
as
our
jet
took
off
in
2001
for
our
20th

trip

we
were
in

resolute

about

after

thought
about
what

been
handed
to
once
again
start
our
lives
anew
travelers
knew
we
would
delight
in
settling
down
being
rooted
in
the
comfortable
and
mundane
and
anxious
to
loose
ourselves
in
new
routines
untested
and
pregnant
with
possibility
we
would
get
to
begin
again
with
no
idea
of
where
we
would
work
or
where
we
would
live
would
have
the
ability
to
reinvent
ourselves
and
our
lives
and
play
a
whole

hand
of
cards

us

back
in

how

with

some
revelations
while
we
were
away
and
chief
among
them
is
the
reinforcement
of
the
virtues
of
simplicity
and
kindness
were
times
while
traveling
when
we
had
an
acute
need
for
a
kind
gesture
just
a
little
one
when
it
materialized
in
the
form
of
a
clerk\xe2\x80\x99s
smile
or
a
pedestrian
who
helped
direct
us
it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
want
my
days
to
be
filled
with
kind
gestures
\xe2\x80\x93
both
those
offer
and
those
receive
this
time
in
my
life
not
interested
in
being
with
people
don\xe2\x80\x99t
care
for
who
aren\xe2\x80\x99t
kind
and
embarrassed
to
be
at
a
table
with
in
a
restaurant
because
of
how
they
treat
the
staff
most
important
thing
in
human
life
is
to
be
kind
and
find
now
have
no
tolerance
for
anyone
who
can
not
be
so.\r\n
'
'\r\n

the
eve
of
our
departure
if
someone
had
knocked
on
our
apartment
apartment
door
and
told
us
we
were
required
to
stay
for
another
few
months
smiles
would
have
overwritten
our
leave-taking
frowns
few
more
months
among
the
wonders
of
would
have
suited
us
just
fine.\r\n
'
'\r\n

knowing
we
would
be
back
on
turf
and
seeing
our
children

and
family
soon
was
not
a
bad
thing
either
home
is
hard
when
you
love
where
you
've
been
but
being
in
the
same
country
as
our
kids
will
make
our
hard
landing
a
bit
softer
was
hard
on
and
at
times
to
have
us
so
far
away
and
while
we\xe2\x80\x99re
used
to
living
apart
the
wide
between
us
was
a
very
real
gulf
that
made
the
separation
more
acute.\r\n
'\r\n
'
difficult
to
admit
but
after
12
months
of
being
on
the
road
my
contentment
pendulum
had
swung
to
the
side
of
longing
for
a
comfortable
home
base
and
the
desire
to
settle
down
into
a
place
we
can
call
our
own
where
we
can
unpack
knowing
that
in
a
few
days
we
will
not
have
to
repack
yet
again
and
where
we
can
become
reacquainted
with
those
favorite
things
we
left
behind
(
our
bed

'\r\n

know
myself
well
and
the
cozy
complaisance
of
life
in
the
familiar
will
only
last
for
so
long
craving
for
novelty
will
once
again
wrestle
with
my
very
real
desire
for
security
some
undetermined
evening
in
the
not-too-distant
future
over
a
glass
wine
in
the
corner
of
an
evocative
bistro
my
always
persistent
wanderlust
will
poke
through
the
fabric
of
our
daily
lives
and
will
declare
my
need
for
some
adventure
some
movement
some
discovery
the
determined
planning
for
more
travel
will
begin
yet
again.\r\n

of
counters
let
me
give
you
a
sneak
peek
at
what
decided
to
use
on
them
you\
're
a
regular
here
you
know
wanted
butcher
block
counters
did
a
ton
of
research
on
them
and
just
could
not
commit
to
them
are
beautiful
but
do
require
a
lot
of
upkeep
and
just
don\'t
want
to
have
to
worry
about
them
also
didn\'t
want
to
drive
all
the
way
to
or
to
get
them
hubby
had
suggested
tile
but
was
adamant
that
did
want
tile
against
it
it
just
wasn\'t
the
look
was
going
for
then
the
night
after
he
suggested
it
had
an
epiphany
thought
why
not
use
wood
look
tile
is
so
easy
and
durable
not
to
mention
cheaper
than
anything
else
and
the
wood
look
tile
is
beautiful.\r\n
'
check
it
out
..\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
this
is
n't
installed
but
had
to
lay
it
out
and
see
what
it
was
going
to
look
like
am
in
is
exactly
the
look
was
going
for
could
n't
be
happier
love
the
way
the
corner
looks
saw
this
idea
online
do
you
think
\r\n
'\r\n
'
thinks
she
is
tired
of
the
remodeling
lol
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
was
really
hoping
we
would
be
finished
before
go
back
to
work
tomorrow

it\
's

the
hardest
part
done
and
after
the

should
explain
what

for

of

who
are

with
almost
all
of

shows

a
is
basically
a
meet
and
greet
but
it
lasts
a
little
longer
and
only
a
select
few
are
chosen
from
the

there
is
pizza
candy
and
several
of
her

are

tours
20

are

chosen
from
the
crowd
by

mom
or
someone
working
with

can
be
chosen
for
many
different
reasons
but
being
a
crazy
fan
is
helpful
apparently
it
does
n't

you
are

at

came
up

leaned
in
to
see
what
was
going
on

at

just

said
yes

you
do

is

disbelief
for
a
long
time
remember
looking
at
my
mom
telling
her
we
got
to
meet
after
the
show
and
mom
saying
's
gon
na
cry
\n
'\n
straight
was
going
to
cry.\n
had
been
thinking
about
this
moment
for
quite
awhile
reading
other
people\
's
stories
about
getting
into
and
looking
at
their
pictures
in
envy
couldn\'t
and
still
can\'t
believe
that
we
were
chosen
of
12,000
people
we
were
picked
was
the
most
excited
have
ever
felt
called
at
work
and
left
him
a
message
telling
him
that
was
going
to
get
to
meet
was
crying
in
that\n
'
sdessage
has
it
on
his
phone
still
but
have
yet
to
listen
to
it
'm
generally
not
that
excitable
so
to
feel
such
intense
emotion
that
was
uncontrollable
was
crazy
to
me
'm
a
pretty
calm
person
most
of
the
time.\n
\n
was
only
the
5th
song
so
we
still
had
quite
some
time
to
enjoy
the
concert
wonder
if
they
did
that
on
purpose
choosing
us
during
remember
my
mom
saying
're
the
lucky
ones
makes
me
giggle
\n
'
'\n
'
and
couldn\'t
stop
grinning
and
intermittently
getting
teary
eyed
and
saying
oh
my
\n
'
'\n
'
though
look
scared
in
this
picture
picture
wasn\'t
had
so
many
emotions
running
through
my
head
and
guess
this
is
the
face
make
when
that
happens
\n
'
those
bracelets
red
bracelets
mean
'
'\n
'
had
seen
so
many
pictures
of
that
note
little
note
be
holding
my
very
own
was
surreal
held
it
at
one
point
and
pretended
she
lost
it
'
'\n
'
the
concert
we
met
in
section
23/24
with
the
other
people
who
had
been
chosen

that
chose
us
explained
the
rules
to
us

'
'\n

how

&
good
folks
at
sent
me
a
promo
pack
with
their
signature
canned
tomato
products
a
box
of
lasagna
noodles
and
a
spatula
nice
spatula
along
with
recipes
recipes
for
'm
always
up
for
a
meal
idea
that
don\'t
have
to
think
about
so
it
was
helpful
to
have
a
night
where
didn\'t
much
have
to
think
about
making
a
meal
just
had
to
add
in
some
mozzarella
cheese
which
we
always
have
on
hand
and
ricotta
cheese
which
we
usually
would
just
use
cottage
cheese
but
went
ahead
and
picked
up
a
carton
of
ricotta
on
my
last
shopping
trip
.\n
'
'\n
'
just
used
the
basic
recipe
often
when
've
made
lasagna
in
the
past
add
in
vegetables
since
my
wife
is
vegetarian
but
then
the
kids
don\'t
eat
it
very
well
no
matter
how
hard
try
to
disguise
the
veggies
basic
lasagna
just
the
noodles
tomato
mixture
and
cheeses
was
easy
to
make
did
it
the
night
before
the
noodles
didn\'t
require
precooking
or
anything
we
had
a
big
pan
pan
of
lasagna
waiting
in
the
fridge
fridge
for
us
and
since
the
2014
were
beginning
we
decided
to
invite
friends
over
for
the
night
\n
'\n
co-worker
from
school
who
has
children
my
sons\
ages
came
over
(
her

was
busy
with
an

unfortunately
went
over
fairly
well
kids
all
ate
it
well
my
youngest
kind

had
to
be
fed
it
but
that\
's
how
he
is
would
have
been
easy
to
make
it
with
some
tasty
add-ins
meat
veggies
etc
)
but
the
basic
one
was
quite
tasty
appreciate
the
recipes
recipes
that
sent
which
are
on
their
website
and
how
it\
's
easy
to
play
with
the
recipe
to
change
things
up
hadn\'t
tried
crushed
tomatoes
before
but
they
worked
really
nicely
mixed
in
with
some
diced
tomatoes
'll
keep
that
idea
in
mind
with
future
meals
nice
salad
and
brownies
accompanied
the
meal.\n

yesterday
wrote
a
response
to
some
of
the
complaining
and
grumbling
had
seen
around
facebook
due
to
a
second
cancelled
day
of
school
on
the
heels
of
break
gathered
a
few
comments
and
reactions
oddly
none
were
directly
on
the
blog

but
all
on
my
facebook
link
to
it
.\n
'
'\n
'
my
children
had
been
getting
at
each
others\
'
throats
for
a
few
days

connected
it
to
when
they
found
the
old
lugged
it
upstairs
from
its
box

in
the
basement

connected
it
to
the

television
and
started
playing

controller
was
broken
so
they
could
only
play
one
player
at
a
time
non-playing
brother
would
sit
close
by
and
offer
helpful
suggestions
during
play
inevitably
led
to
sore
feelings
and
inappropriate
comments
toward
one
another.\n

pointed
out
that
it
didn\'t
matter
if
they
were
playing
video
games
video
games
or
not
were
getting
to
the
point
of
verbal
combat
with
one
another
over
the
simplest
thing
electronic
or
not.\n
'
'\n
'
understand
that
this
is
why
some
parents
hate
an
unexpected
day
off
from
school
on
the
heels
of
sixteen
previous
days
when
we\
've
been
in
the
midst
of
this
polar
vortex
with
-50
degree
windchill.\n
'
'\n
'
that
word
is
about
to
come
into
play
remembered
all
the
writing
've
done
and
all
the
conversations
from
friends
about
the
importance
of
gratitude
in
one\
's
life
yesterday
on
our
drive
to
the
for
a
little
swimming
and
to
get
out
of
the
house
house
after
a
morning
that
wasn\'t
completely
pleasant
around
the
house
house
at
times
made
up
a
little
game
went
like
this
\n
'\n
boys
we\
're
going
to
play
a
little
game
groans
emerge
from
the
back
seat
of
us
is
going
to
think
up
something
that
completes
the
sentence
'm
grateful
for
or
'm
thankful
for
more
groans
'll
start
and
then
'll
count
to
five
and
then
has
to
share
something
before
finish
counting
he
shares
then
it\
's
on
to
who
has
to
share
something
before
count
to
five
it\
's
back
to
me
and
we
keep
going
if
anyone
doesn\'t
think
up
something
before
count
to
five
they\
're
out
'll
give
you
a
few
seconds
to
think
up
at
least
two
things
your
thankful
for
before
start
\n
'
'\n
'
this
time
the
moans
had
diminished
and
they
were
beginning
to
take
it
seriously
started
the
gratitude
kept
going
around.\n
'
'\n
'
were
serious
'm
grateful
for
a
house
warm
house
'm
thankful
that
the
gas
tank
is
full
so
don\'t
have
to
pump
gas
in
this
cold
'm
thankful

our
membership
membership
right
now
'm
grateful

the

we

'm

'm

'm

the
card

.\n
'
'\n
'
had
to
mail
a
package
at
the
post
office
on
the
way
so
had
to
pause
the
game
then
had
already
done
nearly
a
dozen
shares
each
part
of
our
bedtime
routine
is
sharing
something
we
're
thankful
for
each
day
and
then
praying
days
they
have
trouble
coming
up
with
something
this
format
made
it
possible
for
them
to
keep
going.\n
'\n
'
offer
up
a
solution
for
those
days
of
grumbling
fighting
and
complaining
the
gratitude
game.\n
'
'\n
'
ca
n't
hurt
to
give
it
a
try
might
just
be
grateful

been
home
for
two
days
with
no

because
of
the
sub-zero
temperatures

dangerous
windchill

area

on

2

weeks

could
participate
in
the
trend
see
on

complaining
about
having
to
be
around
my
kids
these
two
extra
days
because
we\

all
going
stir-crazy
'm
tired

yesterday
they
were
each
allowed
15
minutes
of

time
and
even
then
it
resulted
in

nothing
to
do
even

there
is
plenty.\n

complaining
only
breeds
contempt

on

do
they

my

can
strive

have
more
gratitude

grumbling
in

that
am
able
to
be
home
with
them
on
these
cold
days
and
not
struggling
to
find
child
care
to
shuffle
them
off
to
that
they
had
some
time
helping
their

bake
cookies
and
getting
to
learn
some
kitchen
kitchen
skills
that
we
had
a
little
extra
time
together
\n
'
'\n
'
we
may
get
cabin
fever
and
get
a
little
stir-crazy
but
how
about
using
that
extra
energy
toward
some
creative
things
to
do
together
(
and
fully
admit
that
don\'t
always
do
this
that
sometimes
it\
's
easier
to
do
my
own
distraction
and
let
the
boys
do
theirs
did
some
cold
experiments
yesterday
along
with
half
the
facebook
population
in

boiling
water
in

see
what
happened
(
it
was
cool

not

it
might

put
a
plate

of
dish-soap
bubbles
outside
tried
blowing
bubbles
to
see
them

most
popped
before
they
froze
had
friends
who
froze
a
t-shirt
and
broke
it
in
half
and
who
played
ice-bowling
's
too
cold
to
be
outside
for
long
but
it\
's
perfectly
fine
for
short
periods
of
time.\n
'
'\n
'
about
teaching
children
a
new
skill
in
the
kitchen
having
them
help
with
a
project
that
requires
tools
simply
doing
some
household
chores
together
boys
enjoyed
simply
pulling
off
the
blue
trim
tape
after
a
painting
project.\n
'
'\n
'
many
people
are
on
pinterest
that
'm
sure
there\
's
plenty
of
great
things
to
try
with
children
there
haven\'t
opened
up
that
time-distraction
've
got
enough
as
it
is
boys
have
filled
up
several

in
the

they
received
in
their

at

creating
things
with
duct
tape

'
'\n
'
haven\'t
really
had
much
screen
time
mainly
because
they\
've
lost
some
of
it
from
bad
attitudes
if
we
hadn\'t
been
coming
off
a
two
week
break
we
maybe
would
have
considered
a
movie
marathon
but
we\
'd
already
watch
several
movies
at
night
in
the
past
few
weeks
but
we\
've
played
plenty
of
board
and
card
games

and
card
games
of
course
there\
's
plenty
of
reading
adventures
we
take
a
break
and
all
read
together
last
year
we
read
through
during
one
evening
a
week
.\n
'
'\n
'
a
good
project
together
is
to
make
a
collage
of
things
you
are
thankful
for
might
just
be
a
better
way
to
spend
a
day
rather
than
grumbling.\n
'
'\n
'
that
said
we\
're
about
to
try
and
get
the
car
car
started
so
we
can
go
to
the
youngest
will
complain
about
the
temperature
of
the
water
in
the
swimming
pool
the
child
has
zero
body
fat
which
is
to
his
detriment
for
swimming
time
'm
grateful
we
have
a
car
car
we
can
travel
with
'm
grateful
that
we
have
a
few
months
of
membership

'm
grateful
we
can
exercise

and
'm
grateful
the

gas
tank
is
full
enough
that
don\'t
have
to
stop
and
fill
it
in
the
cold.\n
'
'\n

can
pass
some
of
that
gratitude
on
to
my

not

for

we
enjoyed

probably
because

was

by

with

superb

through

with

their

protecting

invite
one

for

he
invited
8
friends
over
year
since
he
's
getting
bigger
we
gave
the
option
of
having
a
sleepover
mutually
decided
that
two

was
a
good
start
for
the
first
non-family
sleepover.\n

did
it
simple
and
low-key
but
think
everyone
had
fun
(
except
for
the
friend
who
was
homesick
and
went
home
before
anyone
was
asleep
but
he
knew
coming
into
the
party
that
he
would
have
a
hard
time
staying
away
from
home

he
had
fun

for
bed-time

a

of
birthday
parties
have
gotten
out

's
great
to
celebrate
and
have
fun

we
're
not
going

spend
a
few
hundred
dollars
on
a
party
we
find
that
we
do
n't
need
to
in
order
for
the
boys
to
feel
celebrated
on
their
birthdays
mainly
want
to
hang
out
with
friends
anyway
okay
maybe
open
some
presents
too

we
did
a
grilled
supper
outside
birthday
cake
was
a
frozen

has
become
a
tradition
guess
that
we
make
an
obstacle

in

this

is
a

we
incorporate
the

just
a

played
a

on

a
surprise
\n
26th
birthday
landed
on
a
this
year
and
as
a
result
claimed
he
wanted
to
go
out
on
a
date
the
before
to
celebrate
was
really
happening
unbeknownst
to
me
was
the
planning
of
a
surprise
birthday
party
\n
'
'\n
'
friend
contacted
and
asked
if
he
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
plan
a
surprise
party
for
my
birthday
of
course
said
yes
and
they
went
to
planning
and
generously
hosted
the
party
\n
'
'\n
'
we
had
dinner
at
our
house
house
with
and
and
claimed
they
needed
to
get
going
and
left
right
after
dinner
was
over
after
and
went
on
our
way
with
(
what
thought
was
)
our
plans
for
dessert
and
stayed
to
babysit
the
girls
and
we
headed
out
\n
'
'\n
'
we
got
in
the
car
told
me
needed
to
put
my
scarf
scarf
over
my
eyes
and
cover
them
all
the
way
to
our
destination
said
he
wanted
the
dessert
place
we
were
going
to
be
a
surprise
this
point
still
wasn\'t
suspicious
is
the
kind
of
stuff
does
randomly
so
definitely
didn\'t
think
it
was
a
surprise
party
\n
'
'\n
'
we
pulled
up
to
the
place
and
said
okay
we\
're
here
knew
something
was
up
was
obvious
he
pulled
into
a
driveway
and
not
a
restaurant
parking
lot
he
opened
up
a
door
which
was
obviously
to
someone\
's
home
and
had
me
walk
in
took
off
the
scarf
scarf
we
were
in
's
house
were
a
bunch
of
my
friends
there
saying
surprise
most
definitely
was
surprised
\n
'
'\n
'
and
were
supposed
to
be
there
when
we
showed
up
but
they
came
shortly
after
walked
in
with
wine
to
share
and
some
special
chocolates
for
me
to
not
share
also
had
the
birthday
cake
and
some
cheese
crackers
and
fruit
which
went
out
to
grab
earlier
in
the
day
without
me
knowing
it
got
my
favorite
lemon
cake
from
with
the
sweetest
message
on
it
\n
'
'\n
'
guess
when
and
left
our
house
house
they
grabbed
the
cake
and
other
things
from
the
trunk
of
's
car
since
they
were
supposed
to
show
up
at
the
party
before
us
(
needed
to
stop
for
wine
on
the
way
so
that\
's
why
we
ended
up
beating
them
there
way
all
of
the
goodies
got
there
and
there
was
a
great
group
of
people
there
to
celebrate
\n
'
'\n
'
was
my
first
surprise
birthday
party
felt
so
blessed
to
have
such
a
great
friend
to
think
of/plan/host
the
party
an
amazing
husband
to
pull
off
all
the
last

we
had
already
celebrated
my

to
find

mother
of
young
children
wants
to
hear.\n

this
was
a
special
experience

amazing
\n

looked
at
me
like

there
is
something
to

that
now
we
have
the

doing
activities
everyone
has
an
event
on

just
out

some
patience

the
ability
to
ask

be
able

juggle
and
balance
this
interesting
6

in

'
dinnertime
is
rough
have
to
come
up
with
dinners
that
can
sit
on
the
stove
stove
and
pick
items
that
the
kids
will
eat
warm
or
cold
pie
and
blueberry
pie
was
sitting
on
the
stove
stove
last
night
for
all
of
the
shifts
coming
and
going
the
time
arrived
home
half
of
it
was
gone
and
it
was
still
being
eaten
can\'t
keep
up
with
the
stains
on
the
clothes
and
the
kids
are
spending
their
evenings
running
around
during
the
baseball
games
or
hockey
games
is
not
a
lot
of
home
time
for
the
triplets
because
they
usually
have
to
ride
with
me
to
the
events
never
understand
why
they
can\'t
watch
before
bed
on
the
nights
when
we
don\'t
get
home
until
dark
\n
'
'\n
'
finish
the
organizing
of
my
thoughts
at
the
kitchen
table
kitchen
table
around
11:30pm
on
night
was
all
could
do
to
make
it
back
up
the
stairs
stairs
and
crawl
into
bed
bed
proved
to
be
a
great
morning
because
had
the
week
in
a
snapshot
in
my
head
and
we
ready
to
take
on
the
week
\n
'
'\n
'
night
we
had
an
amazing
experience
church
hosts
35
homeless
people
from
the
every
year
for
a
week
provide
the
food
for
3
meals
a
day
sleep
at
the
our
parish
and
we
provide
everything
they
need
parish
volunteers
to
take
the
people
to
their
jobs
schools
or
to
the
shelters
during
the
day
and
they
all
come
back
in
the
evenings
decided
to
take
on
the
dinner
for
evening
grabbed
4
other
families
from
our
parish
and
we
got
together
to
make
a
taco
night
with
all
the
fixings
mom
's
made
the
food
but
the
kids
all
served
the
dinner
helped
clean
up
and
then
entertained
the
kids
for
the
evening
was
so
enjoyable
for
all
of
us
and
definitely
something
we
will
do
again
in
the
future.\n

we

the

seems
reasonable
it
is
when
you
have

double

you
start
to
get

always
tell
me
about
the
cute

they
shop
at
and
all
the
cool
types
of
food
they
have
have
walked
into

quickly
remember
why
and
are

trusty
go

options
buy
a
dozen
boxes
of
cereal
when
they
are
on

because
we
are
easily
a
box
a
morning
stop
at

outlets
on

way
up

because
ridge
has
all
of
their
bread
next

counter

at
1.00
per

will
take
bags
of
bread
home
and
freeze
always
say
it

not

much
the
cost

the

is
always
interesting

is
never
full
enough
to
where
you
can\xe2\x80\x99t
find
a

but
on
you
have
to
make
sure
and
get
there
early
in
order
to
grab
a
seat
is
especially
true
for
us
because
the
8
of
us
take
up
an
entire
row
holidays
(
no
matter
which
one
it
is

always
exhausting
because
the
amount
of
work
that
goes
into
getting
everyone
dressed
and
ready
in
their
fancy
clothes
is
quite
an
undertaking

a

does

they

end
am
saying

with

out

be

short
can
not
get
the

dressed
to
early

they
will
ruin

home
from

snow
is
melting
and
everything
here
in
is
looking
grey
and
very
drab
is
around
the
corner
but
if
you
look
outside
you
just
can\xe2\x80\x99t
believe
that
it
is
close
only
way
to
really
begin
anticipating
spring
is
to
see
all
the
spring
goods
in
the
stores
and
take
advantage
of
the
increased
hours
of
daylight
are
starting
their
baseball
season
and
everyone
is
scheduling
around
is
time
for
all
of
the
spring
sports
to
begin
and
for
those
of
us
hockey
families
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
would
not
understand
it
if
you
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
experience
it
probably
won\xe2\x80\x99t
believe
me
when
explain
it
of
you
reading
who
are
in
hockey
will
get
it
and
those
of
you
who
are
not
will
question
why
in
the
heck
do
you
participate
in
such
craziness

calls
it
the
and
think
it
is
a
very
fitting
name
for
what
is
about
to
occur.\n

'
dedicate
ourselves
to
a
season
of
hockey
that
runs
through
become
friends
with
the
other
parents
on
our
team
because
we
spend
more
time
together
than
we
do
with
anyone
else
are
on
the
ice
3
days
a
week
and
often
will
add
a
game
or
conditioning
session
in
there
somewhere
all
sit
together
and
cheer
on
our
boys
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
take
long
to
know
each
kid
and
know
how
they
skate
and
what
their
number
is
start
to
cheer
on
all
the
kids
on
your
team
and
celebrate
their
victories
as
if
they
are
all
your

children
heart
drops
when
one
gets
injured
and
you
feel
like
it
is
your
own
spend
weekends
together
either
in
hotels
or
locally
waiting
for
the
games
to
start
rinks

and
leak
and
some
are
wonderful

finding
restaurants
that
will
take
a
reservation
for

after
a
tournament
game
have
witnessed
hide
and
go

in
just
to
kill
some
time
in
between
games
skating
parties
on
our
pond
pond
or
other
man
made
arenas
in
backyards
have
watched
12
year
old
boys
say
dumb
things
and
make
messes
while
showing
off
in
front
of
their
friends
at
a
hockey
dinner
have
carpooled
with
different
families
and
have
visited
many
team
members
homes
for
team
gatherings
boys
have
made
so
many
friends
throughout
the
years
of
hockey
and
we
have
learned
to
never
burn
a
bridge
as
you
will
probably
share
a
team
with
that
person
again
in
the
future
\n
'
'\n
'
never
dreamed
we
would
be
a
hockey
family
never
played
hockey
and
we
really
never
had
friends
who
played
it
took
was
a
neighbor
who
had
a
son
6
years
older
than
my
oldest
who
asked
if
they
could
use
the
pond
pond
in
our
backyard
backyard
to
skate
on
one
winter
8
years
ago
boys
put
on
their
skates
skates
and
watched
the
neighbor
boy
and
it
was
over
learned
to
skate
on
our
pond
pond
and
wanted
more
started
with
a
tot
hockey
program
and
proceeded
to
play
house
for
2
years
boys
improved
and
we
decided
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
crazy
people
and
dove
into
a
\xe2\x80\x9cbeginner
travel
team\xe2\x80\x9d
beginner
mean
\xe2\x80\x9ca
glorified
house
team
with
more
ice
time\xe2\x80\x9d
never
traveled
very
far
and
the
cost
was
reasonable
of
all
the
boys
loved
it
always
kept
excellent
grades
and
never
ever
complained
about
an
early
practice
or
having
to
miss
something
because
of
hockey
love
it
they
crave
it
and
they
want
more
of
it
always
says
\xe2\x80\x9cthere
is
nothing
better
than
a
weekend
with
a
hockey
tournament
and
can
be
on
the
ice
all
weekend\xe2\x80\x9d
don\xe2\x80\x99t
plan
much
in
the
winter
months
because
hours
are
spent
on
the
pond
pond
skating
usually
snow
snow
blow
while
the
kids
are
at
school
and
then
they
come
out
after
school
and
shovel
shovel
so
that
the
puck
puck
will
skim
across
the
ice
\n
'
'\n
'
talk
more
about
the
dance
season
often
ends
mid
and
it
is
not
a
week
later
that
tryouts
are
upon
us
spring
hockey
season
is
short..about
6
to
8
weeks
can
be
a
critical
time
to
make
moves
because
you
can
better
secure
your
fall
spot
if
you
choose
that
team
in
the
spring
will
see
talent
move
from
one
team
to
another
year
after
year
once
heard
a
coach
say
that
the
best
part
of
hockey
was
the
end
of
the
season
when
the
coaches
would
fight
and
steal
kids
and
the
mystery
and
anticipation
of
what
team
will
end
up
being
the
best
is
the
only
time
you
can
double
roster
and
the
coaches
carry
bigger
teams
could
also
call
it
an
extended
tryout
of
and
beginning
of
is
when
everyone
shuts
down
don\xe2\x80\x99t
talk
about
what
they
are
going
to
do
is
no
talk
of
staying
on
the
team
or
leaving
funny
part
is
that
most
people
won\xe2\x80\x99t
ask
others
what
they
are
doing
either
is
a
very
weird
secret
time
in
the
hockey
world
is
when
teams
can
fall
apart
are
times
when
groups
get
together
and
will
all
leave
together..secretly
is
also
lots
of
talk
about
who
is
at
tryouts
could
happen
to
run
into
someone
at
a
tryout
who
is
on
your
team
and
it
is
usually
an
awkward
moment
will
often
talk
about
who
they
saw
at
another
tryout
and
everyone
is
always
at
tryouts
to
see
who
is
showing
up
there
any
new
talent
coming
to
our
tryouts\xe2\x80\x9d
is
a
common
question
among
the
men
folk
will
see
a
cluster
of
dads
standing
around
acting
like
they
have
to
be
there
for
their
kids
tryout
but
secretly
none
of
them
let
their
wives
take
the
kids
because
this
is
like
a
prime
time
social
event
a
presidential
ball
where
your
child
is
being
presented
on
the
ice
and
everyone
is
watching
let
any
dad
fool
you
that
they
are
not
reliving
their
childhood
and
experiencing
an
adrenaline
rush
just
being
there
for
their
kids
\n
'
'\n
'
try
outs
everyone
goes
about
their
business
and
it
is
only
until
all
the
tryouts
are
closed
and
the
rosters
are
posted
do
you
really
know
what
people
are
doing
year
we
are
usually
blown
away
with
some
of
the
moves
but
guess
this
is
part
of
the
game
of
hockey
is
the
part
that
stresses
me
out
the
most
years
we
spend
time
deciding
what
to
do
and
some
years
we
don\xe2\x80\x99t
try
out
for
any
teams
other
than
our
current
one
year
was
the
year
we
chose
to
entertain
some
tryouts
brought
back
the
stress
and
the
anxiety
little\xe2\x80\x99s
are
getting
older
and
they
are
now
doing
their
own
sports
and
we
were
playing
on
a
team
that
was
a
solid
30
minutes
away
have
2
teams
that
are
literally
in
our
backyard
backyard
and
we
wanted
to
check
them
out
is
by
far
the
craziest
time
of
the
year
for
my
family
and
requires
and
me
to
coordinate
schedules
and
be
on
our
game
have
recently
added
all
the
upcoming
events
to
my
calendar
and
have
realized
that
will
have
to
enlist
a
fellow
driver
to
help
us
out
this
year
are
too
many
evenings
when
we
have
3
places
to
be.\n
'
'\n
'
'\n
'
the
end
after
several
weeks
of
trying
out
and
talking
about
things
we
decided
that
we
will
be
making
a
move
for
spring
to
a
team
that
might
(
and
stress
might
be
a
little
bit
better
than
our
current
team
and
it
is
for
sure
a
lot
closer
(
11
minutes
away
did
the
dance
this
year
made
our
commitment
this
past
to
a
new
team
and
although
we
disappointed
some
people
and
surprised
others
we
are
happy
with
our
decision
because
it
was
right
for
our
family

'll
occasionally
get
e-mails
or
questions
on
asking
about
small
business
why
started
it
how
balance
it
how
to
make
a
small
business
successful
etc
don\'t
know
that
'm
particularly
qualified
to
give
advice
on
any
of
those
but
thought
it
might
be
a
fun
idea
to
do
a
small
business
series
on
the
\'ol
blog
blog
and
talk
about
my
experience
as
a
(
very
small
business
small
business
owner
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
good
place
to
start
is
at
the
beginning
started
you\
've
been
hanging
around
here
for
long
you
know
it\
's
a
focus
of
my
and
a
big
part
of
my
day
to
day
life
which
is
something
really
never
expected.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
me
be
super
honest
expected
being
a
stay
at
home
mom
to
completely
fulfill
me
don\'t
know
why
since
had
no
experience
with
it
but
just
kind
of
assumed
it
would
be
everything
needed/wanted
and
that
it
would
be
great
not
to
have
to
go
to
work
every
day.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
first
thing
learned
is
that
motherhood
is
work
you
leave
the
house
house
or
don\'t
have
a
full
time
job
outside
of
parenting
or
not
it\
's
hard
work
and
that
you
can\'t
phone
it
in
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
second
thing
learned
is
that
it
didn\'t
completely
fulfill
me
get
me
wrong
and
don\'t
get
all
riled
up
absolutely
love
staying
home
with
my
daughter
and
if
could
only
choose
to
do
one
thing
that\
's
what
'd
be
doing
hands
down
would
never
trade
this
job
and
try
to
remember
how
lucky
am
to
have
it
but
there
was
a
definite
longing
for
something
else
that
was
coexisting
with
my
love
of
motherhood.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
the
time
was
10
months
old
started
to
miss
doing
non
mom
things
and
feeling
like
wanted
to
do
something
for
myself
think
a
big
part
of
it
was
that
was
two
months
into
our
move
to
to
know
new
people
has
never
been
a
real
strength
of
mine
so
was
pretty
lonely
in
a
brand
new
place
with
a
husband
who
worked
a
lot
were
feeling
stressed
from
buying
our
first
home
a
little
isolated
's
new
job
was
kicking
his
butt
and
it
was
honestly
a
really
hard
time
for
us
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
was
already
making
the
crappiest
)
headbands
little
headbands
for
because
was
going
to
punch
the
next
person
to
tell
me
what
a
beautiful
little
boy
had
)
and
thought
may
as
well
see
if
could
sell
some
on
could
contribute
a
tiny
bit
financially
be
creative
and
have
something
that
was
mine
was
what
did
during
naps
late
at
night
when
was
still
home
alone
with
the
baby
and
it
was
really
therapeutic
early
efforts
were
beyond
embarrassing
and
if
you
bought
something
during
those
early
days
'm
really
really
sorry
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
really
didn\'t
know
if
it
would
grow
or
be
a
total
dud
but
it
kind
of
didn\'t
matter
at
the
time
was
cathartic
and
gave
me
something
to
focus
on
besides
the
stress
and
unhappiness
we
were
working
through
made
me
a
better
mom
because
was
doing
something
for
myself
so
felt
like
had
more
to
give
when
it
was
mom
time
that
make
sense
\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
that\
's
how
was
born
because
duh
they\
're
headbands
headbands
and
for
the
name
of
the
street
grew
up
on
the
little
piece
of
home
really
needed
at
the
time.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
on
'
'\r\n
'
couple
of
ideas
have
for
future
posts
are
how
grew
the
business
talking
about
branding
time
management
while
still
being
a
full
time
stay
at
home
mom
and
anything
else
you
'd
like
to
know
me
know
in
the
comments
if
there
's
something

'd
like

'
'm
the
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
enough
've
been
to
very
few
weddings
lot
of
people
complain
about
weddings
like
they
're
a
drag
or
something
love
them
love
looking
at
all
of
the
people
watching
the
families
interact
figuring
out
who
knows
whom
who
tolerates
whom
you
get
the
idea
love
to
watch
the
eccentric
great
aunt
with
her
shaky
little
hands
clutching
her
champagne
glass
smeared
with
red
lipstick
smudges
around
the
rim
and
crumbs
of
knows
what
permanently
lodged
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
love
the
awkward
little
children
dressed
up
like
adults
the
boys
looking
miserable
and
uncomfortable
and
the
girls
loving
their
princess
hair
and
dresses
and
all
of
the
attention
love
watching
the
bride
's
second
cousin
flirting
with
the
groom
's
best
man
's
brother
and
sneaking
off
to
hook
up
after
just
enough
champagne
wine
and
cocktails
to
chalk
it
up
to
'weddings'.\r\n
'\r\n
'
love
the
formality
the
process
love
watching
the
groom
's
face
and
see
his
eyes
light
up
(
or
fill
with
tears
when
he
first
lays
eyes
on
his
very
soon-to-be-bride
walking
down
the
aisle
toward
him
at
that
moment
always
cry
a
little
love
how
awkward
they
are
love
that
as
a
result
of
how
awkward
they
are
and
how
no
one
really
knows
anyone
all
that
well
no
one
is
really
themselves
rather
people
take
on
a
veil
of
anonymity
pretty
much
everyone
over
indulges
in
some
way
or
another.\r\n
'\r\n
'
love
wedding
food
love
food
in
chafing
dishes
love
the
taco
themes
or
the
tapas
themes
the
themes

choosing
either
the
salmon
or
the
roast

'\r\n
'
's
wonderful
that
everyone
dances
to
all
manner
of
bad
music
laughs
cries
talks
eats
and
everyone
drinks
and
friends
from
all
over
the
country
or
even
the
world
perfect
strangers
yet
all
thrust
together
because
of
another
couple
's
union
everyone
at
least
pretends
to
be
happy
jubilant
even
they
receive
the
next
wedding
invitation
whereupon
they
complain
what
a
drag
weddings
are.\r\n

had
been
at
least
five
years
since
my
last
wedding
until
this
past
weekend
of
my
clients
was
getting
married
she
wanted
her
dog
to
be
in
the
wedding
be
specific
she
wanted
me
to
escort
to
the
wedding
and
make
sure
he
made
it
down
the
aisle
with
his
grandfather
the
bride\
's
dad
ordinary
day
is
an
awesome
dog
and
adore
him
is
a
was
a
hot
day
mouth
breathes
like
a
is
a
tiny
bit
chubby
and
does
not
love
the
heat.\r\n
'\r\n
followed
the
wedding
planners\
instructions
to
the
drove
downtown
at
five
pm
and
parked
outside
the
venue
were
escorted
in
by
one
of
the
planners
then
waited
to
hand
him
off
to
the
bride\
's
father
at
the
proper
time
did
mention
was
wearing
a
tuxedo
snug
tux
at
that
couldn\'t
fasten
the
bottom
button
here
am
in
downtown
at
5
pm
on
what
seemed
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
with
a
chubby
in
a
tux
's
down
the
aisle
promenade
with
granddad
was
to
take
him
and
wait
until
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
at
which
point
the
wedding
photographer
was
going
to
get
a
few
shots
of
the
happy
couple
with
and
were
free
to
go.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
went
as
planned
there
were
no
side
aisles
for
the
first
few
moments
of
the
ceremony
sat
in
the
very
front
row
next
to
the
and
the
parents
who
must
have
wondered
who
this
bold
stranger
might
be
quietly
explained
'm
the
dog
walker\xe2\x80\x9d
and
they
seemed
relieved
's
granddad
walked
his
daughter
and
her
dog
down
the
aisle
and
it
was
touching
always
while
everyone
else
was
craning
their
necks
to
catch
that
first
glimpse
of
the
bride
watched
the
groom
's
face
and
could
tell
exactly
when
he
laid
eyes
on
her
in
her
dress
for
the
first
time
cried
a
little.\r\n
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
that
was
quickly
handed
to
me
and
while
the
ceremony
began
to
hit
its
stride
had
to
awkwardly
duck
back
up
the
center
aisle
the
only
aisle
very
aisle
that
still
had
the
lingering
scent
of
the
bride
's
perfume
as
she
had
just
walked
down
it
not
six
seconds
prior
of
course
with
panting
very
audibly
in
his
tuxedo
graceful
exit
it
was
not.\r\n
'\r\n
'
and
were
shown
to
a
corner
in
the
back
of
the
reception
area
to
wait
for
the
ceremony
to
end
couple
of
the
caterers
and
staff
were
curious
about
what
we
were
doing
back
there
all
alone
no
champagne
'm
the
dog
walker
told
them.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
as
fast
as
it
began
it
was
over
while
was
photographed
with
his
just
married
mom
and
dad
waited
by
the
front
door
of
the
venue
with
the
valets
a
woman
stepped
outside
for
some
air
and
since
we
were
the
only
non-valets
standing
there
she
felt
compelled
to
say
'm
the
groom
's
sister
you
with
bride
or
groom
\xe2\x80\x9d
which
confidently
replied
'm
the
dog
walker
\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n
'\r\n
'
so
as
the
bride
and
groom
went
back
inside
to
enjoy
the
reception
the
meal
the
dancing
and
the
champagne
with
all
of
their
family
and
friends
and
hopped
back
in
the
car
car
to
head
back
to
my
house
house
to
relax
man
was
he
happy
to
get
that
tux
off.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
at
my
place
it
was
dinner
time
fed
the
pups
their
kibble
and
poured
us
a
couple
of
glasses
glasses
of
to
sip
while
we
got
to
our
night
project
making
ricotta
which
was
something
had
wanted
to
do
for
a
very
long
time
\xe2\x80\x93
ever
since
saw
the
recipe
in
six
or
so
years
ago
and
ripped
out
the
recipe
pages
pages
the
milk
and
cream
were
heating
up
on
the
stove
stove
told
him
about
how
it
felt
so
strange
to
have
been
a
part
in
even
the
tiniest
way
of
one
of
the
most
important
days
in
two
people\
's
lives
but
to
have
been
so
very
invisible
wasn\'t
really
even
there
didn\'t
mind
one
bit
\xe2\x80\x93
though
a
glass
of
champagne
would
have
been
much
appreciated.\r\n
'
'\r\n
'
we
sat
down
to
the
table
table
to
eat
our
dinner
of
grilled
pork
tenderloin
with
an
amazing
dry
rub
and
zucchini
with
olives
and
homemade
ricotta
realized
definitely
got
my
wedding
fix
got
the
vibe
watched
the
families
the
couples
the
singles
scoping
out
their
next
flirt
target
was
champagne
and
spicy
margaritas
was
a
taco
theme
with
mariachis
and
the
whole
bit
did
what
most
women
who
have
not
yet
had
their
own
wedding
do
and
have
thought
about
since
they
were
six
years
old
)
compare
it
to
what
they
would
do
differently
take
note
of
what
worked
little
details
d\xc3\xa9cor
style
all
of
it
before
and
left
did
get
a
hug
from
the
bride
and
groom
\xe2\x80\x93
which
is
actually
pretty
hard
to
get
at
a
lot
of
weddings
with
all
of
the
hullabaloo
for
the
dog
walker
