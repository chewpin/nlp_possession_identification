Hasta La Vista, Baby....
October 9, 2013


Oh madpeople.  I’ve made a decision.  This will be my last <object value = "blog" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "e"> blog post </object>.

From the very beginning, I always said that I would wake up one day and pull the plug on the madness without warning.  That day is today.  It’s right now.  For many reasons and for none at all.  I’ve been so tempted to do it for the past six months.  The only reason I have not is because I am still contacted weekly by other suicide widows, and I know my words are helping them to feel saner.  I still want that to be the case, only it will have to be in a different venue.  It can’t be here, on the web.

You see, I’m turning into a real person.  I’m not a cartoon anymore.  So it's time for Chardonnay to hang up the pom-pom marching boots. 

So many people asked me about the anticipated book last weekend at the MMM.  I’m blown away that you would read it.  Blown away that you enjoy my words.  Blown away at the number of people who have read the <object value = "blog" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "e"> blog </object>.  Blown away that so many of you made the trip to party with me and the muthas.

But in my new life, as a real person and not a cartoon character, I’m going to do real people things.  Like possibly date people and be normal and get a job.  I hear it is ill advised to hand over the sarcastic musings of your alter ego on the first date.  I tend to agree with this assessment.

I’ve always been a bit of a mystery girl, so this should not surprise anyone who knows me well.

Until we meet again….love and light and laughter.  Especially laughter.  It really has been the best medicine, hasn’t it madpeople?  Just look at what it’s done for me…….

It's ok to fail. But failure is not an option!
August 21, 2013

For fucks sake, my head is spinning.  One minute we were at the beach trying to decide whether to eat the watermelon now or at dinner, and the next minute I’m careening through the air, having been shot out of a live cannon.  This is how I know it's the first week of school. 

When I put the kids to <object value = "bed" id = "1" type = "perm" agreement = "s"> bed </object> last night baby darling hugged me and said, “Thank you for being a good girl today.”  That obviously means I stayed on green all day, without once moving my <object value = "car shaped marker" id = "2" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ems"> car </object> to the yellow or red portion of the <object value = "behavior chart" id = "3" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "em"> stoplight behavior chart </object>.  This is more than I can say for my beloved mini-me, who is now in first grade and already missed a recess for misbehaving in music.  “He’s nothing like his older brother!” the teacher chuckled.  Lady, I’ve been trying to warn the establishment of this for five years.


I swear to all things that are holy that I will be a good mom this school year.  Which means that I will now embrace the popular bipolar parenting strategy, otherwise known as “ruining my kids.”  This morning after an hour long conversation with the #2 mutha, it was decided that we should write instructions to ourselves on <object value = "index cards" id = "4" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ems"> index cards </object>, for handy reference when that first “D” or “F” test is found hidden in the back of the folder. 


Apparently screaming, “Do you want to live in a filthy ditch under the interstate when you grow up?” is not good for the children’s self esteem.  These types of comments should always be followed by the mixed message goodnight tuck-in, which might go something like this:  “Look, so what, you made an F.  You’re an awesome, smart boy.  Everybody loves you.  Try your best and you’ll pull your grade up in no time.  We’ll study together.”  That’s right.  And if you don’t, you can just live with mommy forever.  Who cares?  I’ll be a lonely, cat lady by then anyway.


Getting this stuff right is so hard.  Especially when ‘what is right’ changes every day.  One day you are to push and encourage and demand that they stand out from the pack.  Be the best!  The next day you are to be accepting and allow the child to establish his own personality and identity.  You are to study with them, and teach them good studying habits.  Oh no!  That was last week.  These children are old enough to be responsible for their own lessons.  Studying with them will make them unable to study on their own.  Just take the <object value = "video games" id = "5" type = "perm" agreement = "s"> video games </object> away so they won’t have violent tendencies.  Great!  Now they don’t have any friends and can’t pick up M&Ms because their hand/eye coordination is so horrible.  Feed them whole grains!  That white bread will make them fat and stupid!  Don’t you know anything, moron?  Grains are the devil!  Stop eating all grains.  Try quinoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  I’m sorry I must draw the line with quinoa.  Especially now that I know it’s not even pronounced kwin-o-a.  It’s keen-wa.  Which is why I can never eat it.  Because I’m not saying “keen wa.”  It’s too stupid.

Honestly, I think I'll just keep flying by the seat of my pants.  My parents didn’t have a fucking clue what they were doing…and look at me.  I’m the sanest person I know.



The only thing that’s really easy is loving them.  I’m good at that part.  It's easy enough to apologe when I yell out the ‘f’ word and say that thing about living under the interstate.  It really is ok to fail.  I’ve failed a lot and I’m still not living under the interstate.
