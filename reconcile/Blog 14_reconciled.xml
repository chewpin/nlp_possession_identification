Some thoughts about moving to a new country (and packing for it)
As I enjoy my last day in Düsseldorf, there are lots of thoughts going through my head.  I remember the first time I moved abroad back in 2005 as a college student -- I actually sobbed to my mother for three hours.  Maybe more.  I recall wailing to her, "But why am I even going abroad?!  I feel comfortable where I am and I like it here!!  What am I doing?!?"  Nine years later, eight of which have been spent outside the U.S., I can only laugh at my college self and think, "How cute."  Because honestly, I wouldn't change the last nine years at all.

I have the feeling that in Shanghai, I will constantly be comparing it to my German experience.  I realize though that this is unfair.  Düsseldorf consistently ranks in the top 10 most livable cities in Europe, if not the world, according to the Mercer Quality of Living Survey.  On the other hand, China ranks as the number one country for expats according to the BBC.  But does living as an expat actually mean a good quality of life?  I don't think it necessarily does, but this will probably be one of the bigger questions I answer in China.

One thing that worries me about living in China is being Chinese-American, but my Mandarin is only so-so.  Of course, I'm eager to improve it, but there is an expectation that if you look Asian, you speak the local language.  It's a common problem in Asia that I encountered in Beijing, Tokyo, and Kyoto.  The attitude is, "Why don't you speak the local language?  You're Asian!"  This video sums up my experience really well:



I actually finished packing today and I must say, I'm either getting really good at this moving-abroad-for-a-year-thing or I'm forgetting something.  (This is the third time I've moved abroad for a year -- once going to Berlin, once with my CBYX year)  I managed to pack one <object value = "suitcase" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> big suitcase </object> that weighs 19.6 kilograms (about 43 pounds) with everything I think I need in it.  I've realized that I wear the same stuff over and over again anyway, so if the thought crossed my mind, "Maybe I should pack that because I might actually wear it," the item got left behind.  This is what my <object value = "clothing" id = "1" type = "perm" agreement = "EM"> clothing </object> looked like just laying it out in the <object value = "living room" id = "2" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> living room </object>living room:



Whenever it comes to larger trips like this (or rather, just moving temporarily), I take a look at what I want to bring.  I considered actually making a chart of how many different combinations I could make -- which <object value = "pants" id = "3" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> pants </object> would go with what <object value = "top" id = "4" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> top </object> and if I could match a <object value = "jacket" id = "5" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> jacket </object> or <object value = "cardigan" id = "6" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cardigan </object> to it, plus <object value = "shoes" id = "7" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> shoes </object>.  I didn't actually wind up making a chart, but I do take that into consideration.  Anything that is too specific and can't be combined with anything else doesn't get packed.  The only exception is a <object value = "cocktail dress" id = "8" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cocktail dress </object>, which was the dead giveaway that I'm not a student anymore.  I actually am bringing it because I thought, "Well, if I get invited to a wedding...or something...I don't feel like shopping."  As a student, bringing a <object value = "cocktail dress" id = "8" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cocktail dress </object> never even crossed my mind.

After laying it out in the <object value = "living room" id = "2" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> neatly, I rolled everything up.  I find that rolling everything saves a lot more space and you can cram smaller things like <object value = "t-shirts" id = "9" type = "perm" agreement = "M"> t-shirts </object> into gaps easier than when it's folded.  Not only that, but I think my <object value = "clothing" id = "1" type = "perm" agreement = "EM"> clothes </object> also arrive less wrinkled when rolled.  I could be wrong on this, but it's just a feeling.  Anyhow, I can definitely fit more rolling everything and if I had actually packed my <object value = "boots" id = "10" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> boots </object> in the <object value = "photo" id = "11" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> photo </object> rather than wearing them, I would stuff them with <object value = "clothing" id = "1" type = "perm" agreement = "E"> clothes </object> too.  Plus, everything looks more manageable and less scary:



With the shoes, I packed two pairs of <object value = "heels" id = "12" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> heels </object>, two pairs of <object value = "boots" id = "10" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> boots </object>, two pairs of <object value = "casual shoes" id = "13" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> casual shoes </object>, and my <object value = "running sneakers" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> running sneakers </object>.  The <object value = "heels" id = "12" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> heels </object> had to be versatile; I can wear them dressed for more formal occasions like putting them with the <object value = "cocktail dress" id = "8" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cocktail dress </object>, but they also had to be not too flashy so I could wear them for work.  The <object value = "boots" id = "10" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> boots </object> are very different from each other; as you can see, I have a pair of <object value = "knee-high boots" id = "15" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> knee-highs </object> and then <object value = "ankle boots" id = "16" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> ankle boots </object>.  Again, they're different from each other but can be worn with a lot of different outfits.  As for the <object value = "casual shoes" id = "13" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> casual shoes </object>, they don't take up much space, but I like having different pairs for city trips.  And the <object value = "running sneakers" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> running sneakers </object> are for the gym (I don't run outside and can't imagine doing so in Shanghai).  Generally, I took the largest items and decided that that's what I'll wear on the plane.  So it's the <object value = "knee-high boots" id = "15" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> knee-high boots </object>, a <object value = "hoodie" id = "17" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> hoodie </object>, a pair of <object value = "jeans" id = "18" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> jeans </object>, <object value = "top" id = "4" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> shirt </object>, and <object value = "leather jacket" id = "19" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> leather jacket </object>.  It saves the space in my <object value = "travel bag" id = "20" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> bag </object>.
.

Finally, after I've evaluated everything rolled up, it all goes into the <object value = "suitcase" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> suitcase </object>:



Like I said, everything gets crammed into little spaces.  <object value = "shoes" id = "7" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> shoes </object> are packed like they would be in a box so they're as narrow as possible.  I've stuck a bunch of flat things in the front pockets of the <object value = "suitcase" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> luggage </object>.  Everything I packed managed to fit and then some, so I added one or two extra <object value = "t-shirts" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> t-shirts </object>, but left the extra <object value = "sweaters" id = "21" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> sweaters </object> out.  If I were moving to a much colder place, I'd consider more warmer weather clothing, but considering I layer everything (<object value = "tank tops" id = "22" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> tank tops </object>/<object value = "t-shirts" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> t-shirts </object> with a <object value = "sweaters" id = "21" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> sweater </object>), it also makes everything more efficient.

I started writing this yesterday, but now it's 6:45 in the morning.  I woke up early so I know I'll be able to fall asleep on the plane.  I could definitely use some more sleep, but I also had to make sure my <object value = "carry-on" id = "23" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> carry-on </object> and <object value = "personal items" id = "24" type = "perm" agreement = "MS"> personal items </object> are ready to go.  And they are.  So let's hope that I haven't forgotten anything super important.  If I did, then it probably wasn't actually super important because I wouldn't have forgotten it in the first place.
