How I made my own <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> wedding dress </object>
I had never made any dresses, skirts, tops or pants before. As a matter of fact, I had never made any single clothing item in my life. I do have a <object value = "sewing machine" id = "1" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> sewing machine </object> and have been sewing totes and making small alterations but that's as far as my sewing experience goes. This is my <object value = "journal" id = "2" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> short journal </object> of how I made my own <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> wedding dress </object> (with my Mom's help) in two weeks without a pattern or any experience in dress making.

4 months before the wedding
We set the date for the wedding and I tell Misha that I want to make my own wedding dress. He is shocked, to say the least. He very gently points out that me making my own dress might be overly ambitious. I think he just wants to make it easy on me but I know it can be done.  Instead of wasting my time searching for the ONE dress, I can just make it exactly the way I want it and save time and money. It would be a sharp learning curve; like being in a sewing bootcamp. 

7 weeks before the wedding 
I finally start planning for the dress. I start researching and figuring out what type of dress I would like and how I am going to make it.  I love long, flowing ball gowns made from natural light fabrics. I also like romantic lace tops and delicate veils.  I make this  little <object value = "sketch" id = "3" type = "perm" agreement = "E"> sketch </object> of what I envision. I realize how much it resembles the princesses I used to draw as a little girl.

6 weeks before the wedding
Still searching for online inspiration. I find this image and love the rich pleated skirt and wide belt. I love how light, crisp and full it looks. I think I found the look for the skirt.

5 weeks before the wedding
It's time to make my sample dress. I pick up 8 metres of <object value = "muslin" id = "4" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cheap muslin </object> and search out a you-tube tutorial on pattern making. I find this great lesson on couture draping on a dress stand. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkppkQEyXG4&feature=related. I follow the instructions to the dot and create a <object value = "sample bodice" id = "5" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> sample bodice </object> for my measurements. It fits perfectly. I am impressed. I really get  into it and make a <object value = "sample skirt" id = "6" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> sample skirt </object> as well, but I am not that happy with it. The <object value = "sample skirt" id = "6" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> skirt </object>skirt will need more fabric to make it fuller.



4 weeks before the wedding
I am having a moment. I tell Misha that we might have to cancel the wedding. The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> dress </object> is not coming together. He laughs and tries to be supportive. I lighten up as well.
I get back to sewing and remake the <object value = "sample skirt" id = "6" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> skirt </object> by adding more <object value = "fabric" id = "7" type = "perm" agreement = "M"> fabric </object> to it. It looks  fuller now. I am optimistic again.




3 weeks before the wedding 
Mom arrives and I am relieved to have her with me. Her sewing experience is invaluable. She learned to sew from my grandmother who was a seamstress. I look forward to working with her on the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> dress </object> and getting some century old sewing tips.  This is becoming a family tradition; my grandmother helped make my mother's  dress.

2 and a half weeks before the wedding
It's time to have some fun. Mom and I are going fabric shopping to Queen St. West. We admire the amazing assortment of luxurious fabrics. Lace, silk and velvet are stacked to the ceiling. We are in paradise!


We buy 1 1/2 metres of <object value = "lace" id = "8" type = "perm" agreement = "EM"> french lace </object>. It is VERY expensive but a must. I could have gotten away with less but wanted to be on the safe side. For the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> skirt </object> and a <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> short sleeve bodice </object> we buy 6 metres of <object value = "silk" id = "10" type = "perm" agreement = "ES"> silk dupioni </object>. GORGEOUS fabric! Happy about going with ivory instead of bright white. Gives it a nice soft, vintage feel.


14 days before the wedding
Mom and I officially begin working on the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> dress </object>. I keep calling it a dress but it's actually a two piece. Making it as a two piece makes our life much easier. I start with the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> skirt </object>. It goes well and I finish it in a day. I have high hopes for finishing everything in a few days. Hm...if I only knew...

13 days before the wedding
I watch several 'how to' videos and start working on the <object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> petticoat </object>. I want the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> skirt </object> to be big and puffy, which means a LOT of <object value = "crinoline" id = "10" type = "perm" agreement = "E"> crinoline </object> for the <object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> underskirt </object>. We soon run out of crinoline and Misha drives us to Fabricland. Luckily, it's five minutes from our <object value = "house" id = "11" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "MS"> house </object>. We have no time to waste.



<object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "S"> Petticoat </object> in making

12 days before the wedding
Still working on the <object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> petticoat </object>. I am sewing on layers and layers of <object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> crinoline </object>. The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> skirt </object> is still not full enough. Let's add another line of frills.

We do another Fabricland run. I pick up a half  metre of <object value = "faux fur" id = "12" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> beige faux fur </object> for the shawl wrap we want to make. It's fall after all and I like being warm, even on my wedding day.

10 days before the wedding
Taking it easy. The <object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> petticoat </object> is coming together. I am feeling very optimistic.


<object value = "petticoat" id = "9" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> Petticoat </object> almost done
8 days before the wedding
It's a beautiful fall day. We take the day off and get out of the <object value = "house" id = "11" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "MS"> house </object> to check out a local organic market. I am surprised how relaxed we are with the wedding in a week and no dress yet.

7 days before the wedding
It's time to tackle the top. We start with the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> sleeveless silk bodice </object>. We use the <object value = "sample bodice" id = "5" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> muslin sample top </object> as a pattern. It's not going smoothly. We are having some trouble fitting it well.
Misha keeps asking how the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> dress </object> is coming along. I think he is starting to get worried.

6 days before the wedding
The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> top </object> is giving us more headaches than we thought. The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> lace </object> is very difficult to work with. It doesn't fit well with the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> silk bodice </object>. We are being patient and still don't panic. 



5 days before the wedding
Tragedy strikes! I slip and fall on the <object value = "back porch steps" id = "13" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> back porch steps </object> and spend the evening at the ER. The outcome is a fractured elbow. Luckily no nerve or muscle damage. My whole left arm gets a <object value = "cast" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cast </object>. Not good timing!




While I am in the ER Mom finishes the <object value = "shawl wrap" id = "15" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> shawl wrap </object>. It looks beautiful!

4 days before the wedding
Work must go on and I am handling the <object value = "sewing machine" id = "1" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> sewing machine </object> with one hand. Mom is doing all the hand stitching. I can't be more grateful. She is amazing!


Sewing with a <object value = "cast" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "MS"> cast </object> on
The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> dress </object> has to be adjusted to my <object value = "cast" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> full arm cast </object>. The left sleeve is cut short. We also keep the side open so I can put the top on. I am also thinking of covering the <object value = "cast" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "MS"> cast </object> with some <object value = "silk" id = "16" type = "perm" statys = "final" agreement = "EMS"> leftover silk fabric </object>. At least it will match.

2 days before the wedding
We are frantically trying to finish the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> dress </object>. The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> bodice </object> still doesn't fit well. Trying it on with the <object value = "cast" id = "14" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> cast </object> is also a nightmare. My arm hurts a lot when I lift it. 
Misha stopped asking how the dressmaking is going. I think he's got the picture.

1 day before the wedding
The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> dress </object> is still missing some snaps and hooks and the <object value = "cast cover" id = "17" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> silk cast cover </object> is not done. Mom is finishing up the <object value = "veil" id = "18" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> veil </object>. I am going to sleep at midnight. I am exhausted.

45 minutes before the wedding
My hair and make up is done and I am all dressed. A friend is stitching together the <object value = "cast cover" id = "17" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> silk cast cover </object> on me. We have 15 minutes to go. 

30 minutes before the wedding
The <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> dress </object> is ready. I am ready. The show is on. Let's get married!


And we live happily ever after.

3 weeks AFTER the wedding
Still waiting for the official wedding pictures but here are <object value = "pictures" id = "19" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "ES"> pictures </object> of the <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> dress </object> on the <object value = "stand" id = "20" type = "perm" agreement = "E"> stand </object>. 


My <object value = "wedding dress" id = "0" type = "perm" status = "final" agreement = "EMS"> wedding dress </object> - the final look

Lessons learned : 

Don't leave the making of your wedding dress to the last minute. 
The petticoat makes the dress.
Always make your own veil, it takes 10 minutes.
Family is the best.
