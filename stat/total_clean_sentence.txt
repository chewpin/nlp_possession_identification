 or is it seventh ?
 when we move to a new city , especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s abroad , it often feels like we started living a completely new life .
 like we are a different person compared to the one that left home .\r\n ' , 'living in a foreign place feels much different than going there as a tourist .
 as a tourist , it seems much harder to experience the way the foreign culture breaths and it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder to find the nooks and crannies which locals are well aware of .
 but immersing myself in another culture was a worthwhile , mind expanding experience.\r\n ' , 'i\xe2\x80\x99ve asked myself why that is , what happens when we move to a new city ? \r\n ' , 'we get shocked out of our minds.\r\n ' , 'literally .
 i could not have imagined a scene like this in my wildest dreams , even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard stories of how liberal dutch people are : imagine a coffee shop in which one could enjoy cannabis is placed in the heart of amsterdam city , right next to a church , which is sitting comfortably next to amsterdam\xe2\x80\x99s famous red light district filled with ladies of the night seductively trying to beckon you over , all the while kids are walking about the premises minding their own business.\r\n ' , 'seeing something so far out of what my surroundings taught me right has shocked me and made me smile at the same time .
 it helped me grow because i realized that nothing is inherently good or bad , it\xe2\x80\x99s only our perceptions that make it so.\r\n ' , 'my mind was also blown during the first few encounters with asian traffic , which made me feel like i was the frog from frogger , the classic arcade game.\r\n ' , 'getting shocked out of our minds is eye opening for a few reasons : \r\n ' , '1 .
 we live in the moment much more often , without even trying .
 when i am shocked , i have no time to think .
 mind\xe2\x80\x93boggling experiences tend to do that to all of us ! \r\n ' , '2 .
 we learn about ourselves by finding new personal limits we might have never thought were there .
 and then we break them , and our comfort zone expands .
 i never thought i might be uncomfortable to see children near prostitutes , but it did stick out in my mind.\r\n ' , '3 .
 after experiences like these , we get to see the world with a new , refined set of eyes .
 and this is excellent , because , as wayne dyer put it , \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you change the way you look at things , the things you look at change\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n ' , '4 .
 doing the things we fear increases confidence , as suggested by steven aitchison.\r\n ' , 'a great way to ground ourselves during these changes in the way we view life is to meditate .
 at least it helped me tremendously.\r\n ' , 'we get to reinvent ourselves.\r\n ' , 'when i moved to belgrade , which my first city away from home , it felt like i could finally get rid of the expectations everyone in my environment had of me.\r\n ' , 'the biggest obstacle to change are often the people closest to us , as we are afraid of disappointing them .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier not to bother with what people will think now , but back then it felt terrifyingly uncomfortable to do something my parents or my friends did not expect of me.\r\n ' , 'in a new city , we almost get to start our lives over .
 it makes replacing old habits with new ones seem easy !
 in fact , we have to make new habits , as everything is new for us.\r\n ' , 'the best habit i picked up after my move to belgrade is to walk for at least two hours a day , and i haven\xe2\x80\x99t dropped it since .
 walking allows me to get to know the city i am in much better , it\xe2\x80\x99s a good exercise and it\xe2\x80\x99s also a form of a meditative practice.\r\n ' , 'the changes that happen within us once we move cities can be so powerful , that i often remember the past not by year , but by place i\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in at that moment in time .
 it feels like i\xe2\x80\x99ve led completely different lives \xe2\x80\x93 i just hope that i have more lives than cats do , because i\xe2\x80\x99m close to nine .
 : ) \r\n ' , 'we learn that people everywhere are people just like us.\r\n ' , 'a man that worked in a guest house ( kind of like a hostel , these are common in asia ) i was in during my stay in bangkok came from myanmar in search of a better life.\r\n ' , 'he had 12 hour night shifts , working six days a week .
 his work visa alone costs his monthly salary every year .
 in about eight years he\xe2\x80\x99s worked at the hostel , he got to go home to myanmar where he could see his children only twice .
 lucky , now his wife is also working in bangkok , but he told me they only get to see each other for a little bit every few days , at his workplace.\r\n ' , 'he knew his situation was less than ideal , but instead of letting it all get him down , he spoke with great vigor of his plans to open up a business back in myanmar.\r\n ' , 'i realized we had much more in common than it seemed at first glance .
 his hopes and dreams are not much different than mine , nor is his struggle to materialize them .
 but he had a much more difficult starting position in this life than i did .
 and to be honest , i wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too keen to trade places with him.\r\n ' , 'we find happiness in unexpected places.\r\n ' , 'trying out a pomelo ( it\xe2\x80\x99s a fruit that resembles an orange and a mildly sour grapefruit ) was extremely joyful for me .
 this is quite an ordinary fruit in thailand , but i had no idea it even existed before i came here.\r\n ' , 'i usually travel just with my backpack .
 it consists of clothes and my laptop , from which i do my work .
 apart from a desk to put a laptop on and stable wifi , the only other things i find necessary for a life that makes me happy is a warm bed to have a restful night in and a shower .
 by moving often , i\xe2\x80\x99ve realized that we really don\xe2\x80\x99t need more \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d in order to have a fulfilled life.\r\n ' , 'the reason i would recommend everyone go and live in a different place at least once in their life , and preferably abroad , is because by doing so i\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that no one is much different from us , i\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that every way of living life is ok and breeds just as many happy and many unhappy people as does life back home and i\xe2\x80\x99ve expand my consciousness drastically .
 in my mind , nothing beats that.\r\n ' , 'in what way has travel helped you grow ?
 do you have any positively shocking experiences from your trips home or abroad ?
 please share them in the comments ! ' ]

 [ 'date : 5/13/2015\r\n ' , 'page : http : //theinspiredroom.net/\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'when we first moved into our house , our backyard was a typical new construction home on barren land .
 no trees , no plants , no landscaping .
 we had weeds and rocks for soil , and that was it .
 after living in old homes with established landscaping to work with , our sad little backyard was a bit depressing .
 i love to design small garden areas but since our soil was filled with rocks , planting was nearly impossible .
 any time i had the urge to plant something , it was a big ordeal .
 i knew i was going to have to enjoy the small improvements we could make each year since a professionally landscaped backyard was not in our plans.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the yard didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any structure at all to begin with , so last year we focused on adding shape , interest and function by creating a pea gravel patio patio for our fire pit , a flagstone walkway , and designated some planting areas.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'by dividing our backyard into four zones , we felt like we could make the most of our space and even almost visualize it eventually being a charming and useful backyard !
 the designated zones also help us to know where to focus our time and improvements !
 this summer we are really excited to be laying a flagstone patio for our table and adding more plants and trees .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'while it will be many years before our landscape is as full and lush as i dream it will be , it helps me to feel like i\xe2\x80\x99m making progress when i zero in on these little areas i can improve right now .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for me to get overwhelmed by the big picture , so it\xe2\x80\x99s nice and definitely encouraging to see each little area coming along !
 one thing i tend to struggle with when i do projects around the house or yard is focus .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m all over the map sometimes , doing a little bit here and a little bit there .
 but since i know concentrated focus is what can quickly transform little uneventful areas into inspiring spaces , i really have been trying hard to grow in my ability to stick with improving one corner at a time until it feels more complete.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'this little spot has been in progress for awhile , but recently i did a little spring clean up , planted a few pots and plants and set up a charming folding trex adirondack chair and end table near my recycled spool table ( you can find the all weather patio furniture from trex ) .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely in love with adirondack chairs ( see this post for some more inspiration ! )
 and this one is so adorable and low maintenance , too !
 perfect for our northwest weather.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'when we look back at the before photo ( above ) of where this area all started and see how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come , we are more determined than ever to keep on giving each corner of our yard a little more love every year.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'a little landscaping , some cute pots and plants , a few accessories and charming furniture made a world of difference ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'do you have a sad backyard corner you could improve this spring ? \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the post was created in partnership with trex .
 as always , my opinions are my own . ' ]

 so yesterday morning when i was out of breath after just walking from my car to desk at work , and after feeling sooooo tired lately i decided to go to the dr , even though he can\'t treat my chronic rejection any more than it\ 's already being treated and even though i was there just over 2 weeks ago.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` had bloods done , x-ray , lung function ( was n't down by as much as i expected given how crap i felt ) was 38 % fev1 % , 6 min walk test ( o2 sats were about 94 % when i started with a heart-rate of 133 , which is high , even for me !
 after 6 mins of relatively fast walking it was 83 % and hr 159 ) .
 still felt like it should have been worse judging by how i felt.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` then the bloods showed elevated white cell count and crp ( ie infection ) and i felt sssoooo relieved !
 even more relived when i had a temp of 38.7 degrees c and dr said my chest sounds crap even though i 'm not coughing at all !
 it means it 's actually something that can be treated and not just my lungs suddenly deciding to decline way faster just before our us trip just to piss me off !
 must have picked up something at work ( where so many people have been sick and it sounds like a hospital waiting room with all the sneezing and coughing ) , but who cares right ?
 corporate culture dictates that you go to work , not matter how sick .
 chris has also been sick ( thanks to someone at his work who sits across from him and came in on thursday very sick ) .
 this is why some post transplant patients do n't work at all , but i wanted a normal life which comes with this risk so it 's just something i have to deal with.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'luckily i wasn\'t admitted ( not that i would have minded too much , sometimes you just want to feel better ) but sent home with oral antibiotics for 2 weeks , slow-k ( guessing potassium was low ) , 30mg of prednisone for 5 days and 2 inhalers .
 also been booked off for the rest of the week with strict instructions to rest .
 this is not a problem as i really feel i need the rest.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` hopefully by the weekend i 'll feel like a brand new person and can carry on looking forward to our american dream holiday.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` happy mother 's day , 2 months and lungs\r\n '' , `` been an extremely fast weekend , it 's insane that it is over already : - ( i did n't even get to sleep late properly : - ( .
 uuuggghhhhh\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'mother\ 's day lunch was great though ( apart from chris missing it due to being sick ) .
 my sis made yummy food and it was just great discussing all our travels ( parentals are also going overseas soon ! ) .
 poor chris caught a bad cold/flu at work and has been suffering for last 3 days now .
 i can not believe i haven\'t gotten sick between him and all the sick people at work ! ! !
 bloody immune system is too strong : - ( \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'fed a friend of mine\ 's two doggies for the weekend , two awesome black spaniels !
 took them for a short walk with my sis .
 made me completely out of breath ... meh .
 she took over and took them for a short run while i waited for them .
 it\ 's really felt like i am struggling more to breathe with exercise these last few days ... making me stress ! ! ! ! !
 today in exactly 2 months time we leave for san fran .
 lungs need to stick it out till then !
 seriously ! ! !
 we\ 've waited long for this so behave ! ! !
 you also know winter is here when they start burning the grass in joburg ... .. which was the case at albert\ 's farm where we walked the dogs .
 you can see the smoke on my pic below ( edited using my new iphone ! ) .
 the buildings in the background is rosebank.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'my car is going in to be fixed this week after my bumper-bashing a few weeks ago , wednesday is visa day ( take two ) , and hoping chris get better !
 also might try to see dermatologist again as one of the little warts he burnt off a while ago seems to be growing bask .
 annoying ! ! ! !
 anyways ... hopefully a productive week ! !

 we are having lunch at my sister\ 's house tomorrow , looking forward to it .
 my mom was 26 when she had me , and 29 when she had my sis .
 crazy to think that when she was my age , she had to cope with a 2-year old and a 5-year old with a chronic disease ( and bad prognosis at the time ) .
 she is probably the strongest woman i know , and the best role-model a girl can have .
 growing up she was the perfect mix if caring and scary , and i guess that\ 's what you need to be when raising a rebel-ish child with cf !
 and not to mention absolutely beautiful , hopefully i have inherited her awesome-ageing genes as well ! ' ]

 i\ 'm trying to load a new photo and it keeps on turning up as a brown square ? ! ? ! ?
 i\ 've uploaded it 3 times now and i give up !
 i hate it when computers don\'t work dammit ! !
 ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'anyway ... christmas was very nice , better than i expected .
 went to church in the morning with my parents and grandfather to my old church .
 i don\'t go there anymore but my parents still do .
 haven\'t been there since xmas 2005 , except for a wedding and a funeral in between .
 was quite a weird experience with my disabled arm and portable o2 , but i\ 'm glad i went .
 after that a whole bunch of family came over .
 my sister , 2 cousins and i watched red eye on dvd , not really a christmas movie , but ok i suppose .
 then came all the eating ! ! ! !
 turkey , lamb and gammon with salads .
 everything served cold , with ice cream , fruit salad and strawberry yoghurt pudding for dessert ...
 yum ! ! ! !
 still eating left-overs ... \n ' , '\n ' , 'yesterday and today was just spent lounging around the house , eating , building puzzle and playing cards .
 not much happening ...
 so i don\'t have much to write about ... the weather is great , perfect summer day , and i wish i could go for a swim at the beach : - ( better luck next year ! !
 ! \n ' , '\n ' , '10mins later ...
 i managed to upload a different picture in the \'about me\ ' section ... it was taken on xmas day ! \n ' , 'posted by alice vogt at 2:29 am no comments : \n ' , 'labels : pre-transplant\n ' , 'tuesday , december 25 , 2007\n ' , `` 't was the night before christmas ... \n '' , 'tomorrow is christmas ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 looking forward to it , although i wish i could have the same level of excitement that i did when i was little ...
 i guess it\ 's just part of growing up , but christmas just seemed that much nicer then !
 this year it\ 's a bit sad that i can\'t breathe properly ( although a lot better than 2 weeks ago ! )
 and don\'t have anyone special to share the day with or watch love actually with ( my favourite xmas movie , but you have to watch it with someone special !
 ) , but i do have things to be thankfull for ... having the most amazing mom and dad and sister ever ( even though they sometimes drive me mad ) , and some good friends etc .
 i feel positive that by next year i will have my new lungs and having an awesome christmas ! ! ! !
 that would be so great ... \n ' , '\n ' , 'the last 2 days have been very nice .
 just watching movies , eating , hanging out with my family etc .
 seems like we\ 're going to have a rainy christmas tomorrow !
 i love rainy weather , it\ 's not something we get very often ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'healthwise i\ 'm doing good , almost no mucus , it\ 's soooooo nice !
 the thing i hate most about having this picc line in my arm though is not being able to do anything to my hair ! ! ! !
 my left hand can\'t reach my head !
 so i can\'t wash , brush , or even tie up my hair !
 and i hate not being in control of how my hair looks !
 it\ 's frustrating for all of us when my mom or sister try to do my hair , because handling curly hair is hard enough when trying to do so by yourself ! ! !
 at least it\ 's washed and as ready for christmas now as it\ 's ever going to be ... \n ' , '\n ' , 'hope everyone has an awesome amazing christmas tomorrow filled with love and remember the real reason we celebrate it.. it indirectly marks the beginning of our eternal life ! ! !
 so much better than just a lung transplant !

 it was the closest i had ever come to dieing , at least that 's how it felt anyway !
 when they loaded me in the ambulance my o2 sats were 36 % !
 the paramedic thought the machine was broken ... ( if i were able to speak at that moment i would 've politely pointed out that the machine was in fact working , and that i could definitely feel the 64 % oxygen that was missing from my body ! )
 luckily in the end i survived after some iv 's etc , just lost some serious weight.\n '' , '\n ' , 'so even though i\ 'm on iv\ 's again for xmas , at least i feel a whole lot better !

 i\ 'm not sure what happened , but it had to do with uploading the photo ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'i\ 'm doing well .
 been on iv\ 's a week now , 2 weeks to go !
 at least time flies , can\'t believe it\ 's been a week already !
 yesterday was a crap day for me emotionally , due to various reasons , but luckily i\ 'm feeling better today .
 got all dressed up and washed my hair ( well my mom did actually , it\ 's impossible with just one usefull arm !
 ) , as we had to take a = `` photo '' id = `` 0 '' type = `` perm '' status = `` final '' agreement = `` sm '' > photo of me and my sister to be used in some christmas gifts !
 ( i\ 'm the short one without the tan ! ! !
 and before you assume she\ 's older , she\ 's not .
 i\ 'm 3 years older than her . )
 we\ 're also going out for coffee later in the afternoon .
 i\ 'll probably be wearing something with sleeves to hide the picc line , which is not cool , as the weather is hot today ! ! ! !
 not much news apart from that .
 my grandfather\ 's coming tomorrow , looking forward to seeing him .
 it\ 'll be his first time here without my grandmother , who passed away last year .
 the other grandparents are also coming down sometime over the weekend .
 also looking forward to lots of eating ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

 feeling a lot better thankfully !
 very gratefull to be coughing less and breathing easier .
 energy still comes and goes a bit , but managed to get a lot of rest in.\n ' , '\n ' , `` saw three friends this weekend , each one very unique .
 seeing them got me thinking quite a bit though .
 it is interesting to observe the effect that my whole situation has had on my friendships ... actually , that is an understatement .
 some of the reactions have upset me quite a bit , and i 'm sure i 'll be getting more suprises in the future .
 and i 'll have to learn how to handle them.\n '' , '\n ' , 'the worst is having to go from being close to someone , to the other person just not really giving a damn , getting too caught up in their wildly exciting life to spare a few moments to send an e-mail or text message , nevermind making a phonecall , even if they know you\ 're \'sick\ ' .
 ( they\ 're most probably not reading this so don\'t start stressing thinking it may be you !
 ! -however if you really think it might be you , just ask me ) then you get the people who you were always friends with , but not close friends , who\ 've been great , and shown care and support all the way , making the friendship so much tighter .
 next up is the weird group , although i generally don\'t deal with them myself , it\ 's usually my friends or mom who have to face them .
 they\ 're the people who fake an interest because it\ 's the appropriate thing to do .
 they don\'t care how i\ 'm doing or what exactly\ 's wrong with me , but they ask anyway .
 and then finally , there\ 's the group who\ 's always been your best friends , who\ 're still there for you all the way , and who have to put up with your moods and frustration and anger caused by all the groups of people just listed .
 to you guys i want to say thank you .
 if i sometimes act like a bitch , it\ 's not you i\ 'm angry with , it\ 's the situation and all the people not supporting me ...
 but rest assured ... when i get those lungs and show my friends the time of their lives ( you will have to pay for yourself though , i didn\'t win the lottery !
 ) , they won\'t be included ! \n ' , '\n ' , `` so to conclude.. cf and especially transplant is the ultimate friend-o-meter ( and love-o-meter , but that 's a story for a different day !

 even less painless than the normal drip needle ( obviously the emla patch- numbs the area- played a role !
 ) , and my doc said it went in \'beautifully\ ' !
 and my favourite nurse was there ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'it\ 's still early in the day , but definitelly breathing easier already !
 looking forward to my body getting a bit of a break after all the coughing and trying-to-breathe it\ 's been through the last week .
 need to pick up a kilo or so as well .
 another amazing thing that happened that i\ 'm so thankfull for , is that on the way to the hospital my dad phoned saying that the final sputum results were back and my evil friend pseudomonas was sensitive to amikacin ! ! !
 let me explain for those who don\'t have cf ... pseudomonas is a very \'promiscious bug\ ' ( yes , those are a doctor\ 's exact words ) , that quickly becomes resistant to any antibiotics introduced .
 lately the only thing that my pseudo is sensitive to ( meaning the only drug that works ) is colistin , which i nebulise .
 however , by some kind of miracle ( according to me ) , one of the drugs i haven\'t used in the past year is going to work again !
 yay ! !

 my dad works in johannesburg now , where i\ 'm going to have my transplant .
 he\ 's on holiday now for 3 weeks or so over christmas .
 will be great to have him around again for longer that a weekend ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'then i just want to thank everyone who has posted comments or sent me messages on facebook or e-mail !

 not a good combination !
 i sent in some sputum ( fancy term for mucus , pretty gross , but you\ 'll get over it ) on monday .
 phoned my doc today , and the results aren\'t back yet , but feeling the way i do and not wanting to feel like this for much longer i told him that i want to go on iv antibiotics ( a drip in other words ) today ! ! !
 so my mom and i are off to the er at st george\ 's this afternoon .
 i don\'t know what to expect though , as previously my doc and i talked about getting a long-line/picc line the next time i have to go on iv\'s.. i\ 've never had one of those , and it sounds scary , and i can be quite a wuss when it comes to these type of things !
 ( transplant\ 's ideal for me then !
 haha ! )
 i will do an update on how it went.. hope my favourite nurse , jackie is there ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'the life-changing thing ...
 i really can\'t say anything at the moment , as it\ 's just a thought/idea .
 what i can say is that last night when i did some half-decent praying for the first time in quite a while , i told god that the two things i\ 'm really scared of at the moment is not getting to jhb in time when i get the call for lungs ( it\ 's a 1hr 40min flight on a commercial airline , and 2.5hrs on charter plane .
 i\ 've basically got 2-4hrs to get there !
 so it will be tight !
 and i can\'t stay in jhb , as the altitude makes it 10 times harder for me to breathe !
 i will need very high o2 support .
 and obviously my social and medical support system is here . )
 and the other thing is not getting lungs in time , or having an infection or something when i do get the call which means they probably won\'t do it .
 and the fact of the matter is they\ 've only done about 3 lung transplants this year !
 which scares me .
 so this morning i got a phonecall from a family friend , with the most unexpected story about a man who had 2 lung transplants who she met via her sister by coincedence !
 i phoned the guy and talked to him and it was so interesting !
 it felt like god might have been answering my prayer right there .
 will keep you updated if this should lead to anything ... \n ' , '\n ' , `` while on the topic of prayer.. one of my new transplant friends ( she had hers in october ) and i said last night how much our faith has helped us through all of this , and it 's so true .
 and the most amazing part is that should the operation not happen in time or the new lungs are rejected , then we 've got eternal life to look forward to anyway !
 so it 's really a win-win situation for us .
 whereas if you do n't believe in god you have nothing .
 all you have is luck , and you have to put all your faith in people .
 and while there are brilliant people out there they make mistakes , and in the end they 're just like you , with no real power whatsoever.\n '' , '\n ' , 'i will leave you now to go and cough some more and try to get myself ready for this afternoon..\n ' , 'posted by alice vogt at 9:00 pm 2 comments : \n ' , 'labels : pre-transplant\n ' , 'wednesday , december 12 , 2007\n ' , 'welcome\n ' , 'hello ! !
 i\ 'm not sure if anyone except maybe some friends and family ( because i\ 'll kindly force them to do so ) is going to read this blog , but i was inspired so much by reading another girl\ 's blog who went through this and much much more , that i decided to try it out for myself ... \n ' , `` apart from the obvious therapeutic properties all of this will have , it will also be a great tool for me , as everyone always wants to know how i 'm doing .
 now they can read how i 'm doing anytime they want to .
 especially those people who are afraid to ask me and end up asking my friends : - ) \n '' , 'right now i\ 'm ok-ish .
 had a difficult morning .
 it started out fine , did my first neb ( inhaling medication using small machine called a nebuliser ) , had breakfast and did my normal morning e-mail/facebook check , then proceded upstairs again for remaining nebs and lying on physio-mat == ( don\'t know the technical term for this device , it\ 's almost like a back-massager that you lie on , which pounds out mucus !
 it belongs to my physiotherapist ) .
 after coughing my lungs out etc , i realised that i\ 'm running a fever .
 got back into bed .
 realised i\ 've only got an hour before i need to be at physio ( i go 3 times a week , she \'beats\'/pounds my chest to get more junk out ) .
 decided that i don\'t have the energy to go and asked her if i could postpone it or something .
 they\ 're so amazing , both of them , that i ended up receiving a home visit !
 ( i also received a home visit from some dude from from the municipality who wanted to read the metres ... think he got the shock of his life when i opened the door in my pjs with my o2 restraining me like a dog tied to a tree or something , and acting like nothing is wrong !
 ) \n ' , 'luckily my day got better after that , had a peacefull afternoon and my mom and i just got back from having some mcdonalds drive-thru cappuchino at the beach parking lot ! \n ' , 'i think this is enough for today ... \n ' , `` p.s .
 i 'm not very technologically advanced.. and still figuring out how everything here works , so bear with me ! \n '' , 'posted by alice vogt at 4:33 pm 3 comments : \n ' , 'labels : pre-transplant\n ' ]

 what is in your diabetic closet that needs to be cleaned out ?
 this can be an actual physical belonging , or it can be something you 're mentally or emotionally hanging on to .
 why are you keeping it and why do you need to get rid of it ?
 ( thank you rick of ra diabetes for this topic suggestion .
 ) \n '' , '\n ' , 'i know over the years i have been listed as uncompliant in my medical files .
 the saddest part is that i was trying .
 i know now even with the best a1c i have ever had i know my previous endocrinologist listed me as uncompliant even though i worked really hard on reviewing my number and making changes as necessary .
 i know my current family practice dr. lists me as uncompliant because of the fact i have complications and even thought my a1c is excellent .
 i work very hard to keep lows at bay and keep my retinopathy under control in fact i only see the retina specialist twice a year because it is considered stable currently.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know it infuriates me that they make assumptions the minute you mention complications which to some dr.\ 's means i don\'t try , don\'t test and don\'t care but i find it insulting that they write me off .
 they tend to not give patients the benefit of the doubt .
 i know that so many people including nurses feel that they are free to comment negatively to the patient because you have complications .
 i wish they would teach physicians not to use the word uncompliant with diabetic patients .
 i know i do request my medical records and i do read what they say .
 i have fired dr.\ 's after reading the medical records .
 i hire them for a service not for judgement.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know i wish more dr.\ 's would understand that being a diabetic is not easy and getting perfect numbers is not possible .
 i also wish they would at least look at my current a1c .
 i know i went to my current eye dr. who referred me to my current retina specialist .
 i know i told him my a1c has been been below 7 for 7 years now .
 i happened that day to have a copy of my a1c and he seemed shocked .
 i know he mentioned most of his patients a1c is not that great but was surprised i had retinopathy .
 i know dr.\ 's are human but i have personally experienced way too much assuming and not enough checking by dr.\ 's the past couple of years .
 i really wish they would move toward not using the word uncompliant because it is really defeating statement to the patients who really are trying.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know i can\'t change much except addressing the dr .
 i currently see .
 i have requested that one dr. remove the word uncompliant from my file because i showed him my a1c and my graphs all the diabetes data .
 i don\'t find it fair that i am automatically considered to be a bad patient when i work so hard .
 i am trying to let this go emotionally but i know it will take time to get over the fact that i can\'t change all dr.\ 's .
 i am hoping that some day they won\'t use that term about any diabetic but for now i can only hope that someday that is the case.\n ' , 'posted by tarra at 6:42 am no comments : \n ' , '\n ' , 'tuesday , may 12 , 2015\n ' , 'blog week post # 2 keep it to yourself\n ' , ' \n ' , ' blog week post # 2 keeping it to yourself\n ' , '\n ' , 'click for the keep it to yourself - tuesday 5/12 link list.\n ' , `` many of us share lots of aspects of our diabetes lives online for the world to see .

 ) \n '' , '\n ' , 'i know i have always prided myself on sharing everything including the moments of scary which i have had quite a few of the past seven year in particular .
 the certain areas i don\'t share on my blogs is who i am dating and if i am single etc .
 i feel that if i was married i might share a small bit but i am most comfortable just leaving that information out .
 i know another area i won\'t share is other conditions outside my diabetes except the one\ 's that are other endocrine issues.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know i do have rheumatoid arthritis , celiac\ 's disease , diabetic retinopathy and hypoglycemia unawareness .
 i have always shared as i develop complications right away on my blog .
 i have found that i feel better if i share as it is happening .
 i know i did with my retinopathy diagnosis but i had hypoglycemia for several years before i started my blog .
 i like to share as it happens because at one time i was looking for another person who was going through the same complication but found no blogs .
 that is why i started blogging back in may of 2012 .
 sharing my diabetes related information is wonderful in that i can put this stuff i am carrying around online instead of on my own shoulders .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'i know this past year in january i would not disclose what type of procedure i was having because it was not diabetes related but i blogged about it because it was causing many issues for me with my diabetes .
 i feel that sharing exactly the issue was best kept to myself because i know i needed the privacy i know i wished i could share but i know that it really was best left unsaid .
 i am doing so much better now with the quick procedure that was done and my graphs on my dexcom are almost back to they way they were back when i first started on the dexcom .
 i honestly had no idea how much the issues was causing issues with my diabetes which does happen .
 i am thankful i had a wonderful dr. who my endocrinologist recommended .
 i know i think we all have some things that are just not appropriate for our blogs .
 i know i felt better in the long run not discussing it and i know having some privacy is really nice in times like these.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know i am hoping you all understand the reasoning behind not sharing my procedure and my dating life because i think that information might create issues .
 i know if you list a person on your blog anyone can read it and so you also need to think about them .
 so by leaving the off the blog i can discuss them without naming them but i find it is just better to keep my that off my blog and just in my personal life .
 there will always be parts of our lives we won\'t share .

 i really wish that my father would understand it 's not 1980 anymore .
 my father when i wanted to run a half marathon said it was too dangerous and diabetics should not be running half marathons but i disagree i know plenty who have .
 i am still planning to run a half marathon but after i explore some other adventures i want to go on .
 i know a big part of the reason my father thinks this is because i ca n't feel lows but he also has only seen the occasional low when i visit at christmas so he really has not real concept of what my life is like today .
 i did have a low that needed assistance but my dad could have given me a glucagon shot and been fine .
 \n '' , '\n ' , `` i know each year my goal is always the same to reduce my lows and i get better at doing so the longer i have had hypoglycemia unawareness .
 i know i will have added precautions and planning even for non exercise activities .
 i am okay with that because you get used to those changes .
 i know my father about lost it when i told him next year i am planning to go to california to get accelerated free fall training basically solo skydiving .
 i know most people are thinking wow that is dangerous .
 i know most of the adrenaline junkie activities i love are dangerous but i am never as happy as when i am going on my next adrenaline rush .
 i know i also plan for example zip lining , and a couple new adventures as well .
 i know i wo n't let diabetes win.\n '' , '\n ' , `` i know i will have critics who think i am reckless or foolish but i know me and what i love .
 life is about living the life you want and some times getting the adrenaline rush is exactly what i needed .
 i know i went sky diving back in march and i was in a high for three days afterwards and i never stopped smiling .
 i felt like i had my zest for life back and i am so know this is what i have been missing in my life .
 i know some of my family is like that is awesome you love sky diving and others are like you ca n't do that .
 i know i can and i will be doing it .
 the issue for me normally is n't me doubting that i can do it but normally my family or others.\n '' , '\n ' , `` i do plan on running a half marathon but that has been put on hold while i pursue skydiving for a while .
 i do plan on pushing myself to achieve my goals and dreams .
 i have been told no so many times in my life but i have always been able to accomplish these goals .
 i know when my endocrinologist tells me that i can go skydiving i should be fine .
 i know i told her my plan i have for skydiving and she looked at my graph for the day and she said i looked great .
 i also get better at planning these activities .
 also a word of advice do n't have the dr. notate in your file you are sky diving if you injure yourself the insurance wo n't cover it .
 \n '' , '\n ' , 'i am so over joyed that i am going to do skydiving because i can and honestly i deserve to be happy like any other person does .
 i am tired of my father trying to trap me into the thought process of the time i was diagnosed where they limited everything in life .
 i know with all these incredible diabetic athletes why could i not .
 i know my body has always given me so many challenges but i do not give up easily and i will continue to search for my next crazy fun activity because life is so much better when i do.\n ' , 'posted by tarra at 6:23 am 10 comments : \n ' , '\n ' , 'friday , may 8 , 2015\n ' , 'when juggling several conditions at once\n ' , 'i know at time it is so easy forget i even have rheumatoid arthritis since i was 19 .
 i know most of the time it is just in the background and i don\'t have to do much .
 i know since my last flare up i have never really got back to where i was previously .
 i know i have noticed changes in my hands and my ability to open the plastic bags in the produce section is almost always too much for me to handle .
 i know i am thrilled with my current medication but it seems to work okay but i am worried about the long term changes with my hands .
 i know recently i have noticed that in the mornings when i am at my stiff i have trouble opening doors now and i have noticed it can at times be painful to be typing on the computer in the mornings until i have gotten my joints loosened up .
 i know i want duchess to help at times by pressing the button on the door but they are so stiff she can\'t .
 so i am stuck having to hit the button which hurts .
 so i know i need to discuss this with my dr. next week.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know she has always considered my ra to be mild and not even moderate but with the recent changes i am not sure what to think .
 i know i work out frequently but normally i seem to handle it pretty well .
 i do know that the recent changes make me really nervous that i won\'t get back to the way things used to be .
 i know my current medication methotrexate worked really well at first but not so much now .
 i know it is supposed to help stop the progression of my ra but i feel like that is not the case currently .
 another issue i have found is that normally with methotrexate you can\'t use advil .
 sadly my dexcom will not tolerate the use of acetaminophen .
 so basically if i hurt myself i can\'t use any pain relief medications.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know i tend to be clumsy at times and i have had to just grin and bear it but at other times i take the risk and take the advil .
 i know this is not recommended because it reduces the effectiveness of the methotrexate .
 so i have only done it once or twice .
 so now i am questioning in general what i can do .
 i am hoping my dr. will help me find a solution but i am feeling more and more like this current medication is not for me .
 i know i am willing to try new medications with the hopes they last right up to when i can take my next dose .
 i know most of the time i feel the medication wearing off on tuesday night and i can\'t take more till thursday night so technically i might just need a higher dosage but trying to juggle my needs , need to avoid tylenol because of the dexcom just makes things even more complicated .
 \n ' , '\n ' , `` i know at times i worry way too much about my collection of autoimmune disorders i am collecting which include diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , and celiac 's disease .
 i know my conditions tend to show up in ways i am not always expecting but hopefully i can find some relief soon.\n '' , 'posted by tarra at 8:37 am no comments : \n ' , '\n ' , 'thursday , may 7 , 2015\n ' , 'messing with the dexcom numbers\n ' , 'i love the concept of the dexcom and what it can do for most people .
 i know i am the exception in that my numbers on the dexcom tend to inaccurate for example last nigh .
 i ate dinner as usual and i head to the gym .
 i start working out and i expect to see my blood sugars rise during the beginning of my work out since i do not bolus for my meal before going to the gym .
 so i start working out and i am 20 minutest into my workout and i look at my dexcom and it has one pointed straight up but i was expecting to see my dexcom showing that it was leveling off and will be showing a drop .
 so i continued working out another five minutes .
 then duchess runs over to my machine and stares at me .
 i know the look when i need to check .
 so i finish the last two minutes and then test .
 sure enough i was actually 69 and the dexcom still had me moving up when i was actually low.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know during these times having duchess is really important .
 a great deal of the time my dexcom will say it is moving up quickly when it is not most of the time .
 so i always test to see where i actually am .
 i know even when i have had bad lows where i needed assistance normally 40 minutes after the event the dexcom finally catches up .
 i am not sure why there is such a delay but i also know that medtronic\ 's cgm is even worse for me .
 so i do the best i can with the information i have .
 i have recently moved my cgm blood sugar down when i start working out .
 by starting my blood sugar levels at a lower than my actual number has helped improve the accuracy of the alerts some what i am seeing it alert ten minutes after my low instead of 40 minutes .
 i have not run into any issues with doing so .
 i was worried about highs but that has not been an issue so far.\n ' , '\n ' , 'posted by tarra at 7:57 am no comments : \n ' , '\n ' , 'wednesday , may 6 , 2015\n ' , 'changing needs\n ' , 'i know recently i have noticed that my rheumatoid arthritis medication does not seem to be working as well as it once was .
 i am not sure if i need a higher dosage or just need to change medications .
 i know the methotrexate for the most part has worked well but it really has some down sides to taking this medication .
 i do lose more of my hair than normal , it tend to catch more colds and i can\'t drink more than two drinks in one week .
 i know most of the time it seems to work okay but an issue i have noticed is that by wednesday of each week i can feel more pain and stiffness .
 it is like the medication stops on tuesday evening and i am unable to take more until thursday evening .
 i know each morning i have noticed that i have had increasing difficulty with my hands and being able to get my body to function like normal .
 so i know my up coming appointment with my rheumatologist i know i have some issue to discuss.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i am not really sure what the dr. is going to recommend but after a year of the methotrexate i am not feeling like it is for me .
 i am hoping she is willing to help me find a drug that will not have as many restrictions like methotrexate does such as i have to limit sun exposure which is difficult when living in texas .
 i also need to avoid people who are sick because it does suppress the immune system .
 then i am not able to even enjoy the occasional drink with friends because it can elevate the levels of your liver which is not good .
 so i know i am not really happy at this point and i am hoping they have other options available but i also know my insurance only covers one or two ra medications currently the rest are not covered .
 so my choices are limited which does not help .
 all i know is that today at work i have needed to get up more because my medication does seem effective enough .
 hoping i can get some results i need soon.\n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' , 'posted by tarra at 10:45 am no comments : \n ' , '\n ' , 'tuesday , may 5 , 2015\n ' , 'my retinopathy experience\n ' , 'i know i have been thinking back to my retinopathy diagnosis several years ago .
 i know i started my blog around the time my retinopathy showed up in my life .
 i remember i woke up one morning and noticed black spots in my vision which were small hemorrhages in my eye .
 i went to the eye dr. that day because i was concerned .
 he took one look and said that i had a retina detachment .
 so i was told with my eyes dilated i needed to go to the retina specialist now .
 so i left the office very scared .
 i know they rushed me back immediately when i arrived at the retina specialist office .
 the nurse comes in and starts to ask me questions .
 i know she said they believe i have retinopathy and i knew that was most likely the case .
 the nurse then says to me i guess you should have taken better care of yourself .
 i told the nurse that was not the case and i did not deserve to be treated this way .
 i told her to leave her judgement at the door.\n ' , '\n ' , `` next thing the dr. comes in and looks at my eye .
 he says the good news is that i do n't have a retina detachment but i do have retinopathy .
 i also had quite a few new blood vessels which are leaking and hemorrhaging .
 so they say i need to be treated immediately .
 the dr. says to help stop of the bleeding i need to have an injection into my eye .
 i know when he said that i was shocked that was what they were going to do .
 i have always had a thing about anything being close to my eye so it was difficult .
 i hated the injections they were not painful but they worked really well .
 then i was told i needed to come back for more procedures which they used dyes which could show the blood flow in the eyes called an angiogram .
 they also did regular pictures and other exams .
 i know it was an overwhelming experience and i know i was extremely scared at the time .
 i decided that i would take things one day at a time .
 i also knew that i wanted to make sure my a1c was under 6.5 to prevent any further complications and i actually had been in that range for several years so i just needed to make sure i stayed in range.\n '' , '\n ' , 'i know they then said i needed laser procedures done which i was okay with .
 i had no idea that it could be as painful as it was .
 i also had no idea that my retina specialist at the time was not following the standard procedure for doing laser procedures .
 he had me laying back in a chair trying to laser my eye but that did not work because my eye was watering the whole time .
 normally you are in an up right position sitting as the dr. does the laser procedure .
 i know my dr. then told me i needed to have a vitrecotomy since the laser was not working .
 i know that seemed wrong he only tried twice to laser my eyes .
 so i went to get a second opinion .
 i meet another young woman who had retinopathy and she spent time talking with me .
 i found out that if you do have a vitrectomy you could also need further surgeries and she had several .
 she told me to try and see if the laser procedures worked first and not to jump into surgery.\n ' , '\n ' , 'so i took her advice .
 i changed retina specialist and he did laser procedures and a year and half later i have had not procedures done and no bleeding .
 so i know the surgery seems like a good idea but for me i knew i just wanted to avoid the surgery if at all possible .
 so for me it worked .
 i know my experience is not typical but we need to all communicate what we need .
 for me avoiding surgery has been a blessing and i today still have 20/20 vision and no new blood vessel growth in my eyes .
 i do work everyday to keep my eyes healthy by keep my a1c in a good range and exercising.\n ' , '\n ' , `` i know this journey was scary and i encourage everyone to share because i know i did not find any one sharing their experiences several years ago .
 it can be incredibly scary but i know for me i found taking it one day at a time made it all manageable .
 i also did a great deal of research which helped me have realistic expectations .
 i know i felt better knowing about procedures before they were done .
 so i made it a point to read up and educate myself .
 i know i do n't know what i would have done without my friend online who shared her experience .
 i know i made the decisions i needed to make for me .
 i know i learned i need to advocate for myself as well .
 i know some of the best advice my dr. gave me is to sleep on two pillows to help keep blood from flowing into your field of vision when sleeping .
 most hemorrhages happen when you are asleep .
 my first retina specialist did not share this advice so i felt he just was their for the money always wanting me to go for a surgery .
 i know i have never been happier to fire a dr. than that one.\n '' , '\n ' , 'i know today my eyes are doing great and i hope to see them continue to be in good condition .
 i know i have learned so much from my experience .
 i also did not realize how strong i was until i walked this road alone .
 i know i hope everyone continues to share their experiences because it means the world to someone who is going through it completely scared .
 i know that my combination of therapies of injections , laser and keeping a1c down have all helped me to get my retinopathy stable and stay stable the past several years.\n ' , 'posted by tarra at 7:17 am 4 comments : \n ' , 'email this\n ' , 'blogthis ! \n ' , 'share to twitter\n ' , 'share to facebook\n ' , 'share to pinterest\n ' , '\n ' , 'monday , may 4 , 2015\n ' , '35 years where did the time go\n ' , `` i know last year i really was struggling with my diaversary but this year is so much different .
 i know my goal this year was to make my diaversary a little more fun .
 i know growing up we never celebrated me making it another year or did anything on the date .
 in fact i do n't know the exact date of my diagnosis .
 my mother would have possible know the date but she passed away seven years ago .
 so i have not idea except that my mother told me i was diagnosed when i was 18 months old at all my dr. appointments .
 i was diagnosed back in 1980 boy does this make me feel old but back to the subject at hand .
 so this i woke up that day feeling completely in awe that i have type 1 diabetes and that no matter what has happened even with dealing with complications i feel like i have accomplished a great deal .

 i still jump out of planes , run and exercise like everyone else .
 the only thing that has changed is that i have to pre-plan everything out but at the end of the day it is really a small change .
 i know i have had to learn so much from my hypoglycemia unawareness it has taught me to appreciate things even more .
 it has taught me to really pay more attention to what foods and i am eating and how it affects my blood sugar .
 i know through it all i am still shocked it has been 35 years .
 i know i am proud and i know my mother would have been proud as well.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know my life with type 1 diabetes has never been easy and will continue to be full of challenges .
 i know my diabetes has taught me to be incredibly resourceful and creative in finding solutions .
 i know i also owe my parents a great deal gratitude for doing an exceptional job of managing my type 1 diabetes .
 they were incredible in their dedication .
 i also admire how they found ways to make the worst part of diabetes more fun when ever possible .
 i am sitting here today in awe of it all .
 i also i am thankful that i continue to work at my diabetes .
 i know i would not be the same person today without my diabetes and i am celebrating that today .
 i am also celebrating i have been blogging for three years now .
 it is incredible how much my blog has changed my life for the better as well .

 mommy said we were doing her head in.\n ' , '\n ' , 'so mommy brought me in the house through the front door , but guess what ?
 daddy was not outside .
 he had come into the house and he forgot to close the back door !
 so i just ran right in the front door and out the back door .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'right into the yard with barking bailey .
 mommy heard the screen door slam and ran through the house to get me but i was too fast .

 there is blood.\n '' , 'keep reading : \n ' , 'reactions : \t\n ' , 'posted by joanne brokaw at 1:12 pm 2 comments\n ' , ' \n ' , 'what happened when i peed on the pillow\n ' , '\n ' , `` i did n't do it .
 whatever it is you 're mad at.\n '' , '\n ' , `` so about oneteen days ago , i did a bad thing .
 it was a big bad thing .
 i peed on mommy 's pillow .
 on her bed.\n '' , '\n ' , 'uh oh.\n ' , '\n ' , 'but guess what ?
 mommy didn\'t get mad .
 instead she said , `` bandit , that is not like you to do a naughty thing like that .
 what is wrong ?
 `` \n ' , '\n ' , 'i just looked at her .
 what are you talking about mommy ?
 the ghost puppy did that.\n ' , '\n ' , 'the next day , mommy called dr. hawkins and said , `` bandit is acting squirrelier than normal and last night he peed on my pillow .
 can you make sure he is not sick ? ''
 she also tattled on me and told the doctor that i broke my leash and went to visit my pal nico and i snarled at him when he sniffed my butt .
 mommy can\'t keep any secrets.\n ' , '\n ' , 'so i had to go see dr. hawkins and she ran experiments on my potty and felt my whole body all over and then used big needles and sucked out some blood .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'you should know that i have had my blood sucked out before , when i ate that cat toy and had to go to the hospital .
 ( remember ?
 that is when i met santa ! )
 they did experiments on my blood and i got my superpower ( talking to mommy in my head ) .\n ' , '\n ' , 'mostly i am pretty good when they want to suck out my blood and run experiments .
 but this time i did not like it when they poked me with needles .
 so i growled and snapped .
 but they kept poking .
 so i made a big stink bomb with my butt to tell everyone to go away and stop poking me .
 my butt bomb stunk up the whole vet office .
 but guess what ?
 they stopped poking me !
 haha on them ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'dr .
 hawkins said my pee might maybe have an infection and that is why i peed someplace i am not supposed to pee .
 so i had to take some medicine .
 and dr. hawkins said my back leg and hips were a little stiff and ouchy and that might be why i have been snappy and snarly.\n ' , '\n ' , 'now i am all done with my medicine and i have to go pee in a dish next week and have my potty experimented on again .
 but i am feeling better !
 back to romping and barking with my pals ! \n ' , '\n ' , `` i am telling you this story because hopefully you have a mommy that does n't get mad when you do something bad that you do n't usually do and instead checks to find out what 's wrong with you and never ever hits you but only loves you and takes care of you .
 although mommy says if pee on her pillow again i wo n't be allowed to sleep in the bed any more .

 [ 'date : 5/13/2015\n ' , 'site : http : //jazzabellesdiary.blogspot.com/\n ' , '\n ' , 'saturday , 9 may 2015\n ' , 'life lately ... \n ' , '\n ' , 'it\ 's been a while since i\ 've posted on here , over the last year i really have stepped back from my blog a little , more so in the last six months .
 why ?
 i\ 've just not been feeling that inspired with it - the more i try to focus on my blog the more i compare myself , my photography and writing skills to others , which is unnecessarily bringing me down .
 and let\ 's be honest , i work monday - friday so at the weekend sometimes all i want to do is be lazy and spend time with my boyfriend and family .
 i absolutely love my blog and what having it has done for me , but right now i\ 'm doing what i can to keep my happiness levels up .
 and let me tell you , i really am pretty happy ... \n ' , '\n ' , 'life - things in my life have been going pretty well this year , i\ 've been feeling so content .
 i\ 've started to get the itch to move out into my own home ( hello , endless interior shopping ! )
 and settling down a little , but i\ 'm not in too much of a rush and i know that things will happen at the right time for me .
 i\ 've reached a milestone on my savings and i\ 've been making the most of the time i spend with my family , which are two of my priorities at the moment .
 \n ' , 'love - if you haven\'t worked it out from my twitter and instagram yet , i\ 've fallen in love for the first time with the most amazin\ ' guy .
 i never believed it when people would say `` you\ 'll meet someone when you least expect it '' , but in this case it certainly was true .
 i\ 'm a pretty emotional and sentimental person so i won\'t ramble on for too long , but being in love and knowing that i\ 'm with someone who loves me for who i am has made me feel so overwhelmed with happiness .
 even my manager has said that when she looks at me she can see heart emojis above my head , haha !
 \n ' , `` work - i ca n't believe that i 've been in my new job for five months already !
 saying that sometimes it feels like longer .
 it 's all been quite a learning curve for me , but i 'm really proud of my career progress over the last 3 years .
 going from a sales assistant to a visual merchandiser then the flagship marketing and events assistant at cath kidston , before moving to tatty devine to become their marketing executive , dabbling as a stylist in between .
 all of this without going to university shows it is possible , and even better ?
 i have no debts to pay off !
 \n '' , 'well-being - since i wrote my \'flaws and all\ ' blog post back in october , things have remained pretty similar .
 i\ 've been taking little steps to improve my confidence , complexion , health and fitness , and besides two little blips since then ( thanks to the pill and anxiety ) , things have been lookin\ ' good .
 i\ 've been getting earlier nights , making time to read , eating more fruit and veg , not working from home and generally just trying to keep positive .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'this post is a little bit different for me , but it\ 's something i just had the urge to write , so i do hope you liked it !
 i don\'t know how often i\ 'll be blogging in the near future , but you can always find me posting away on twitter , instagram and facebook .
 i\ 'll chat to y\'all soon .
 love , jazz .

 i\ 'm currently cosied up on the sofa feelin\ ' very happy , as today marks the start of ten days i have off work !
 it\ 's been a long few months , so i\ 'm super excited to spend some time with my family in bournemouth , sleep in and catch up on general life admin .
 i plan to put together a little \'life lately\ ' post soon so i can update y\'all up on just what has been going on in my life ( and quite a few lovely things have happened recently , i have to say !
 ) , so do look out for that .
 \n ' , 'anyway , to the outfit ...
 following on from my last outfit post , this look was also shot by the lovely amber on a chilly day in february .
 this dress has become my go to outfit as of late - it\ 's super flattering for my shape as it nips in at the waist ( giving me the illusion of hips , wahey ! )
 and the length is just perfect .
 teamed with my extra sassy knee high boots and a classic fedora , this combo certainly did make me feel fancy enough for my chelsea surroundings .
 love jazz .

 [ 'date : 5/13/2015\r\n ' , 'site : http : //www.diaryofanaspiringloser.com/\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'wednesday , may 13 , 2015\r\n ' , 'holding both\r\n ' , `` lately i 've been thinking a lot about how this maintenance journey is about holding seemingly opposing concepts .
 the first concept goes like this ... \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'it is not ok to overeat .
 it is not ok to mindlessly eat a bunch of junk .
 it is not ok to engage in bingy behaviors that leave me feeling regretful and yucky .
 it is not ok to skip my workouts .
 it is not ok to eat in a non-goal-oriented way.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'and the second concept is ... \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` when it happens , it 's ok.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` this is a contradiction and our brains do n't really like that .
 but it 's a dissonance we have to get used to , we have to teach our brains to hold both , because both are true.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` how do i do that ?
 part of it is about staying in the moment .
 when i was in my mid-20 's i read wherever you go , there you are by jon kabat-zinn .
 that was my first introduction to the concept of mindfulness .
 mindfulness is about being in the present moment .
 if we stay in the present moment , we can really only hold one of the above concepts at a time.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` in this moment , these choices are not ok , and i will not accept them .
 in this moment , i will hold that eating a ton of chocolate at the staff meeting , just because someone brought it , is not permitted .
 by who 's authority is it not permitted ?
 by my own , of course .
 i am the only one in charge here.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` but an hour later , when my authority was compromised , by me , i must hold something different .
 it happened , it 's ok .
 in this moment , it is ok. because if it 's not , i have to scold , point fingers and otherwise assign blame .
 blame can lead to shame .
 shame leads to weakness , hiding , fear .
 none of those feelings will help me make the next right decision.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'so it\ 's ok in this moment .
 and then not .
 hmph , i started out by saying we have to hold both but i guess what i\ 've described , by bringing in this mindfulness idea , is that we only have to hold one .
 at a time .
 no dissonance , no conflict .
 the question becomes , `` what is true in this moment ? ''
 what do i need right now to move toward my goals .
 whatever i need , hold that .
 forget the other .
 the other is not here , in this moment .
 the other can be used in some other moment when it is needed.\r\n ' , 'you might also like : \r\n ' , 'fat acceptance\r\n ' , 'time is of the essence\r\n ' , 'fitbie fame and 30 miles on the road\r\n ' , 'linkwithin\r\n ' , 'posted by michelle at 9:59 am no comments : links to this post\r\n ' , 'tuesday , may 12 , 2015\r\n ' , 'salami , surgery and a social life\r\n ' , `` things were getting better with my back , until they were n't .
 i 'd hoped to get out for a run or something this weekend but it did n't happen .
 i 've been averaging twice a week for exercise , which you know is n't making me happy .
 but i 'm taking my own advice , focusing on a mix of patience and confidence .
 things will get better , my body will come around.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'el dorado kitchen , sonoma\r\n ' , 'on the eating front ... i\ 'm eating .
 some days too much but mostly staying within reasonable boundaries .
 i\ 'm going out more than i typically do , building up a social life and finding ways to be out in the world , meeting people , trying to have fun .
 so much of being social involves food .
 i\ 'm posting a couple pictures from recent outings.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'so i focus on the at-home meals as being clean , whole , light meals which then allows me to indulge when i\ 'm either restaurant dining or at a dinner party .
 not that i can indulge at every restaurant meal or dinner party , the calories would add up .
 i use `` calories '' for lack of a better word - i think you know i don\'t count calories.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the view from the bar at coqueta.\r\n ' , 'still , i\ 'm not sticking to this as well as i\ 'd like , evidenced by , for example , my eating salami for dinner lately when i\ 'm home alone .
 salami , crackers , a string cheese ... maybe a bowl of cereal .
 more salami .
 these `` dinners '' are more like grazed snacking and i have a couple problems with this behavior.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'first , i don\'t feel so great physically when i eat like this .
 i notice my body isn\'t in the same groove .
 my skin doesn\'t like it and my `` system '' gets wonky .
 second ... well , second are the calories of course .
 if my plan is at-home meals that are clean and light - salami must be the complete opposite of clean and light .
 the good news ?
 the salami is gone , i finally ran out last night .
 and i won\'t be buying more for the time being.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'all that said , my weight is staying within range ... i was 144 pounds last wednesday .
 that was a 4+ pound drop from the week prior , which is crazy .
 i expect it will bounce back up by a couple pounds this week .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` ok , enough about all that ...
 i have a tummy tuck update .
 after healing from the surgery i noticed my skin was a little funny where the incision ended , near my hips , kind of crinkled up .
 apparently this happens a lot so the doctor said he could fix it when i 'm ready .
 also , i 'd paid extra to have my love handles removed but they are still there , so he 's fixing that too .
 i 'm scheduled to go in for what i 'm calling a touch-up , in july , going under the knife again , hopefully for the last time .
 i 'm sure i 'll post pictures after all is said and done.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` everything else in life is going well .
 the kids are doing great , miguel and i are humming along with our new life , all working together for the greatest good ... and i 'm enjoying the ride .
 i might sign up for a tri training plan , just to give me some structure , even if i do n't actually do the tri .

 in the past i had a pretty good idea what caused it but this time i wasn\'t certain .
 in my last blog post i wrote about going on a 6 mile trail run/hike .
 i went to the gym for the next three days in a row and i remembered working out pretty hard .
 i felt really strong and good .
 that and i was dealing with stress that i was taking out on the dumbbells.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'anyway , the pain grew to the point at which i had to stop exercising altogether for a couple weeks .
 eventually i was able to get back to doing something light on the weekends , i took a 10 mile cruise around town on my bike .
 the next weekend i went on a 3 mile easy run .
 i\ 've since done a couple gym sessions but sort of here-and-there , not trying to get back to a routine just yet .
 oh , and i went on a mountain bike ride last weekend , the shoreline trail at china camp state park .
 i\ 'm way out of mountain bike practice.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` so my back is not 100 % , maybe 75 % , and i 'm still treating it with tlc .
 while my mind is looking forward to getting back to something regular , my body is n't ready for that just yet.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'on the food front , things continue to go pretty well .
 i\ 'm still attending ww meetings every week for a reminder , for inspiration and motivation .
 i haven\'t been tracking lately , my weight is back in my official ww `` goal '' window ( 145-149 ) but just barely .
 all in all , i\ 'm quite happy with how things are going in this department .
 it feels as though i\ 'm starting to get a more intuitive relationship with food , the foundation of that being i have a radical knowledge that i can eat whatever i want , and however much i want .
 all the choices are mine and mine alone.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'enough on that ... the final thing happening is , i have a cold .
 wah !
 sniffles , blocked up nose , hyped up on cold meds .
 at least it\ 's coinciding with this back pain thing so i\ 'm not getting sidelined by it .
 my hope is that about the time the cold goes away , maybe my back will be ready for more regular exercise.\r\n ' , 'you might also like : \r\n ' , 'a bump in the road\r\n ' , 'recovery week revisited\r\n ' , 'welllll , what can i say ? \r\n ' , 'linkwithin\r\n ' , 'posted by michelle at 1:50 pm 3 comments : links to this post\r\n ' , 'monday , april 6 , 2015\r\n ' , 'this is an other\r\n ' , `` some days are better than others .
 today was an other .
 funny thing though , the last few times i 've had monster-bad days , i have n't wanted to eat .
 in the way-back past i would 've wanted a bag of chips and a pint of ice cream - for an appetizer .
 but now , it 's as if i ca n't really enjoy food when i 'm feeling like crap .
 at least in the initial jolt of pain or sadness .
 unfortunately , it does n't really last .
 give it a day or two and i 'll probably want to dive head-first into that ice cream.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'aside from the state of my personal affairs , food and exercise are going well .
 last week , the week following the half-marathon , i hit my goal to exercise four days .
 i went to the gym on monday and did a light , post-half recovery workout .
 tuesday i was hit with a wave of exhaustion in the late afternoon and thought it smart to get some rest .
 i did just run 13.1 miles on sunday after all.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'wednesday , thursday and friday saw me hitting the gym after work and doing my thing .
 i\ 'm still not doing what i used to do before this whole divorce/life-change thing reached a peak , but that\ 's ok , i\ 'll get there eventually.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'jumping back to wednesday , i lost 2.2 pounds this past week .
 it was no surprise given i\ 'd gained 3.2 pounds the week prior .
 something crazy is happening with my weight , jumping around like that .
 i\ 'm curious to see what it will be this week .
 so i\ 'm 149.8 , which is .8 pounds over what i\ 'm allowed to be to maintain free lifetime status at ww ( my official goal weight is 147 and we\ 're allowed to be +/- 2 pounds of that weight ) .
 i\ 'd really like to stop paying that $ 40 monthly pass fee so i hope this is the week.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'but i\ 'm definitely not starving myself to get there .
 friday evening i had dinner in a restaurant .
 i had a few sips of wine , a bit of bread , shared fried calamari for an appetizer ( i know , i know , but it was so good ) and ordered grilled salmon for the entree .
 the salmon came with steamed veggies and the smallest portion of roasted red potatoes i\ 'd ever seen .
 and a small cannoli for dessert .
 i entered in everything into my tracker and came to 26 points .
 not too bad.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we had a family easter party on saturday ( the only day that worked for everyone ) but i made smart choices there ( including no candy ) , knowing i was attending a dinner party that evening .
 the dinner party was over the top , with one of the guests being a bona fide chef who prepared the food .
 he served everything small-plate style and we all stood around the island eating and drinking while plate after plate of yummy stuff emerged .
 oh.my.calories was there a lot of food .
 and it was good .
 check out the spread.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` deviled eggs with smoked salmon , grilled lamb , bison burgers , beef carpaccio ... and the list goes on and on .
 anyway , i comforted myself by mentally increasing the mileage in my planned sunday run by 1 mile with every passing hour .
 points-wise i decided to just wipe out all the weekly points i had left plus any unused activity points ( including those i 'd earn on sunday 's run ) .
 who knows if this is right , but it 's too much to attempt calculating .
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'sunday came around and it was time to pay the piper get outdoors and experience the joy of physical exertion .
 a trail run was just what i needed to clear both my head and my body .
 i did a loop route in the henry coe state park , a trail i hiked for the first time about a year ago.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the loop is 6 miles .
 some parts were either too steep up/downhill to run - up being too hard , down being too scary - or the trail was too rocky/narrow .
 so where i could run , i ran , otherwise i hiked , quickly , to keep the exertion at workout levels ( vs sunday stroll level ) .
 check out the elevation profile .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it was a beautiful day , a little chilly and windy at times but the scenery more than made-up for the cold.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'henry coe state park in april\r\n ' , 'that brings us to today .
 i made good food choices , balancing out the weekend\ 's bacchanalia , and went to the gym after work .
 i was a little stiff from the trail run but mentally , i really needed a workout .
 i started with the hill loop around my gym , 2.34 miles in 10:26 pace .
 considering the size of the hill i ran over , that\ 's darned good .
 actually , it\ 's good no matter how you look at it ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` then i went inside to do legs/shoulders/core .
 that was asking a bit much from my body .
 i had to cut short the number of lunges because my legs were just not up to it , and after about 2/3 of my total workout , i just stopped altogether .
 my body was n't happy and i was n't in the mood to push it .
 aside from my being emotionally tired , i probably did n't eat enough to fuel what i was trying to do either.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'but i closed out the day eating all 26 of my daily points , leaving the 6 aps i earned in the gym for tomorrow if i want them .
 it\ 's a sad day , to be sure , when i\ 'm ambivalent about eating all my points.\r\n ' , 'you might also like : \r\n ' , 'is it friday yet ? \r\n ' , 'starting fresh , in this moment\r\n ' , 'eat , rest and carry on.\r\n ' , 'linkwithin\r\n ' , 'posted by michelle at 10:13 pm 6 comments : links to this post\r\n ' , 'sunday , april 5 , 2015\r\n ' , `` san francisco rock 'n ' roll half-marathon 2015 race report\r\n '' , 'wow !
 what a day .
 i can\'t wait to tell you about it .
 i\ 'll start with the friday before .
 i had planned to go to the gym but the day got hectic and i decided since i was running the half on sunday , it\ 's fine to just rest .
 saturday i indulged in some treats , carb-loading is always a great time to indulge .
 i started the dinner hour by having two cream puffs , one vanilla and one chocolate .
 i couldn\'t finish them both but i gave it my best effort.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i headed over to the expo to pick up my bib and check out all the vendors .
 except i had the wrong closing time and i got there just as they were closing up !
 if i had gotten there literally a minute later i think i would have missed it , they were locking the doors when i walked in .
 i was bummed to miss the expo but happy to have my bib and shirt .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i paused on the way out to take a picture with the route map .
 then it was off to dinner .
 i had bread , pasta with clams and yes , dessert , even though i\ 'd had the cream puffs .
 you can get away with stuff like that when you\ 'll be running for over two hours in the morning : ) \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'after dinner i went to an art theater across the street to watch the labyrinth , one of my all-time favorite movies .
 i know , it\ 's kind of cheesy camp fun , but i love it .
 it\ 's kind of like my personal monty python and the fact that it was playing in the city the night before my race , when i had to be right across the street to get my packet , was just too perfect.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` just like sarah and hoggle , i 'd be running soon.\r\n '' , 'after the movie it was straight to bed , a 6:30am start time is going to mean an early wake up.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` i stayed in an sf motel just a couple miles from the start .
 when i got up i realized i 'd forgotten to plan for breakfast .
 despite still feeling the weight of yesterday 's eating , i knew i needed breakfast .
 the coffee place around the corner did n't open until 6am , which was cutting it close but really , it was my best option for food .
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` warning , poop-talk ahead ... i was hoping to go # 2 before the race , aside from the physical concerns , knowing all the food i 'd put into my body the night before was messing with my head too .
 i had some coffee and oatmeal ( more food !
 more need to poop ! )
 but nothing happened in the bathroom department .
 on my way to the starting line i glanced longingly at the porta-potties ... wish i had a need to use one but my system was just not budging .
 and i had no time to wait , i 'd have to run the race and just hope my full system would n't be a problem.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'i was in corral three and i got there about 10 minutes before the first wave took off .
 it was still dark out but considering we were right on the ocean , i wasn\'t freezing .
 i had sweats and a zip up jacket over my running clothes , i\ 'd planned to toss both at some point during the race .
 but since i wasn\'t freezing i took the sweats off before the start .
 i did a couple knee raises and then , before i knew it , my corral was taking off.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the start\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'my view in corral three\r\n ' , 'i had no expectations for myself in terms of pace or overall time .
 given how i\ 'd crammed my training into four weeks , i knew i had to go easy if i was going to make it .
 we ran along the ocean for a few blocks and then turned inland .
 as we soon as we turned the corner , bam , a hill .
 i heard a fellow running groan at the sight of it and i reminded myself , `` hills always look worse than they are .
 `` \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'turning inland , and heading uphill .
 photo from sfgate.com\r\n ' , `` i just put my head down and ran , ran , ran ... it was such a beautiful day , i love san francisco , and this was a picture perfect sf day , made for running .
 we wound our way through some neighborhood streets and eventually popped out next to the ocean again .
 i 've always wanted to run on this portion of lincoln blvd , perched above baker beach , with a postcard worthy view of the golden gate and marin headlands.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'my garmin of the first few miles\r\n ' , 'but holy hills ... this was the worst part of the hills .
 the race organizers had some pretty funny signs to help us up the hill , this was my fave.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i can relate.\r\n ' , `` again , head down , and run .
 i made it up the series of hills and felt a wave of pride and self-confidence come over me .
 now on to the bridge .
 i 've run over the golden gate enough times to know ... it is not flat.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'elevation profile\r\n ' , 'as you can see , the bridge trends uphill on the way over .
 but i was so distracted by the fact that we were running not on the pedestrian path but on the actual road ... so awesome .
 the views were spectacular .
 i had to get out my phone for a couple pics.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'heading over\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i hadn\'t carefully studied the route map and i was terrified that we\ 'd have to run down the hill on the other side of the bridge , then back up and over ... i\ 've run ( and walked ) that hill and it is a painful spiral uphill .
 i sighed relief when we turned around in the vista parking lot ... no hill !
 i ditched my zip-up jacket around this time , the weather was just perfect .
 i mean , really , look at that sky.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'on the return trip\r\n ' , `` notice the solid stream of runners filling the road in the distance ?
 i wish i could 've captured what i saw , so inspiring.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'an official pic from 2014 ... runners on the bridge , i love it ! \r\n ' , 'so back over the bridge and down toward the marina .
 along the way i\ 'd had some mild stomach discomfort , along with what felt like pre-cramping in my legs ... i worried something might derail me but reminded myself that for now , i\ 'm not derailed so just keep running !
 the cheer squads along the way also helped .
 there were also a couple/few bands but i had my headphones on and didn\'t really listen to them.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'a pic of the lead runner ( courtesy sfgate.com ) \r\n ' , `` besides , with scenery like this ... it was easy to forget my worries .
 i started to drag around mile 8 , so i had two shot blocks , which gave me just the pep i needed .
 i think i had two more around mile 10 but i ca n't remember now.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'after running along the marina we turned inland toward our big downtown finish.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` the last mile of this race was the best last mile i 've ever run .
 ever .
 it was a series of downhill blocks and i was running my heart out .
 people were lining the street screaming for us and i was filled with a love for running , a love for what my body could do , a feeling of overwhelming gratitude and happiness .
 yes , running can feel this good.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the last mile\r\n ' , 'i crossed the finish line feeling like a million bucks .
 i have to post the proof of this pic because the photo website is messed up and it won\'t let me purchase this one yet .
 but rest assured i\ 'll be buying this one ... i love it ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i looked down at my garmin and saw 11:07 pace ... no way !
 i couldn\'t believe it.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'took me 20 seconds to remember to stop my garmin \r\n ' , 'of course my official pace was a bit slower because it assumes i ran 13.2 miles , when i really ran 13.31 due to poor tangent running .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'no matter ... i ran the race in 2:27:33 ... still faster than my first ever half-marathon , which is always my minimal time to beat.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i got my medal and headed toward muni .
 i wasn\'t interested in listening to music , being there on my own , i just wanted to get to a shower and lunch .
 but boy oh boy was i happy ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` well , there you have it .
 sign up by midnight tonight and this race can be yours for only $ 50 in 2016 .
 despite telling myself , somewhere around mile 6 , that i would never run another half-marathon again ... i 'm off to sign up .
 because this is worth it .

 lay on the stress ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'in my last update , we were dealing with a denied offer , a day full of disappointing showings , and our begrudging return to the hunt .
 but people , i am a story-teller and i refuse to disappoint.\n ' , '\n ' , `` so here 's what 's happened : \n '' , 'textconvo\n ' , 'we picked ourselves up from the day of terrible , disappointing showings and kept checking every single listing that popped on the market ... within minutes of it coming on the market .
 i mean it when i say this is a part-time job .
 it has been detrimental to be one of the first showings on a good house.\n ' , 'a house came up on the market on tuesday afternoon .
 tom and i looked it over and got pretty obsessed .
 in fact the texting convo to the right was our reaction .
 so i emailed our realtor twice in 3 minutes and told her we wanted to see it asap ... and then i also texted her to make sure she really knew the extent of our craziness.\n ' , `` she got us a showing the following day ( wednesday ) and it was exactly as we 'd hoped .
 perfection .
 however , we knew others had somehow seen it before us .
 so we put in a really strong offer before the day was out , to which they had 24 hours to accept or deny.\n '' , '\n ' , '\n ' , `` thursday , we waited and waited and waited .
 somewhere after 24 hours had passed , we finally got word that they had received multiple offers and they wanted everyone 's highest and best by friday at 5pm .
 we decided our first offer was truly the strongest we could do , so we left it the same , not knowing how many others we were against .
 people , we offered their list price , and we assumed others went over .
 this is actually really common in the market here and in other cities.\n '' , 'thinking they would get the offers and choose the highest one , we expected to hear something before the end of the day or in the morning on saturday .
 nada .
 fearing we would lose this beautiful house , i wrote the owners a heartfelt letter praising them for taking such immaculate care of their home and property .
 i complimented them and then explained that we were looking for our first home and yada yada yada .
 guys , i went ultra cheesy and talked about our future children and how i really want to raise them in this home .
 i put my heart on my sleeve , but admitted that i understood it has to come down to their best financial choice .
 i had my realtor pass on the letter and let it be .
 \n ' , 'late that night , our realtor called and asked if i was with tom .
 she told me to put her on speakerphone because our offer was accepted !
 another offer would have netted them more money , but we have a flexible closing date ( and i wrote the world\ 's sweetest letter ) , so we won !
 we are over the moon excited and grateful ! !
 ! \n ' , '\n ' , `` so now the clock starts ticking .
 our due diligence starts tomorrow .
 this means we have to officially put down our earnest money , meet with our loan officer and see what they can officially work out for a loan , and get an appraisal and home inspection done ( which , for the sake of transparency adds up to 1k or more that the buyer pays out of pocket ... and if you end up deciding the property needs too much work , wo n't appraise near enough to your offer and the sellers wo n't negotiate down , you just lose that money and never see it again ... just fyi ) .
 once you find out its actual worth or any issues it has , you negotiate that the seller needs to fix this or that , or they need to bring down the price to come closer to appraisal .
 all this happens in only two weeks or less.\n '' , '\n ' , 'this is all very exciting and we definitely spent saturday night talking about how we\ 'd decorate it and where we can put our furniture ... but anything could happen and we or they could choose to back out .
 if we end up needing to renegotiate and one side or another doesn\'t budge , that could cause this train to leave the station .
 hopefully that doesn\'t happen , but we need to keep it in mind .
 the house isn\'t ours until the keys are in hand ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'thanks so much for reading along ( this was super wordy , sorry ) and please send us your prayers that all goes smooth and without a hitch ! \n ' , '\n ' , `` any advice for this point ?
 something we should remember to look for while walking through with an inspector ?
 something we should n't forget to do ?
 breathe perhaps ?
 ? \n '' , '\n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' ]

 woah .
 in some ways it feels like i just had my surgery a few weeks ago , but in other ways , it feels like i\xe2\x80\x99ve been an amputee my whole life.\n ' , '\n ' , 'the past six months have been nothing short of incredible .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve grown , i\xe2\x80\x99ve changed , and i\xe2\x80\x99ve become stronger .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve been constantly reminded of just how great the little things in life are .
 as a result of the event that occurred on november 25 , 2014 i\xe2\x80\x99ve had some amazing experiences , including speaking at schools and retreats , being part of a council at the hospital , and participating in a commercial .
 i finished my first post-amp 5k , dipped my toes in the ocean for the first time in years , and learned how to drive again.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i\xe2\x80\x99d be lying if i said that the past six months have been perfect or without challenges .
 it certainly has not been easy .
 my patience has been tested as i have had to wait for things : a leg , the ability to drive , and the freedom to walk unassisted , to name a few .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve worked through post-op pain , discomfort from overuse of my leg , and soreness from tough pt sessions .
 but although it did not all come easily , it\xe2\x80\x99s all been beyond worth it.\n ' , '\n ' , 'if you told me six months ago that i\xe2\x80\x99d be this happy right now , i would\xe2\x80\x99ve probably said something like , \xe2\x80\x9csure , keep telling yourself that.\xe2\x80\x9d i didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that life would ever be bright and happy again .
 now , though , i wake up each day with gratitude in my heart for how far i\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten .
 i am so thankful for everyone who has followed my story , sent prayers my way , and supported me through it all .
 who would\xe2\x80\x99ve known that something so dark and so scary could give way to something so beautiful ?
 i am humbled to be where i am today.\n ' , '\n ' , 'those tears and those fears on the morning of my surgery would have disappeared immediately if i would have known then how amazing my life would soon become .

 \xe2\x80\x9cmom , come here !
 mom !
 that girl\xe2\x80\x93why does she look\xe2\x80\x93 ? \xe2\x80\x9d her mom tried to hush her before she went on .
 \xe2\x80\x9cshh .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ll explain it to you , but you have to come over here , \xe2\x80\x9d she said , leading her daughter to a different area .
 when they came back to where i was , the girl and her brother tried to catch another glance at my leg while their mom tried to stop them from staring by offering other things to look at.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i think situations like the one described above come from the desire to not intrude or offend .
 we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say or do the wrong thing , especially around people who are \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s totally understandable , but sometimes i think our avoidance is counterproductive .
 when i hear people talking about my leg in hushed voices , or pulling their kids away from me to talk about what they think happened , it only magnifies the idea that something is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d with me .
 ( side note : i don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think anything is wrong with me , and the world knows how proud i am of my leg .
 but when situations like this happen , it communicates that idea to others .
 the idea that something is wrong and that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talked about .
 but it should .
 ) \n ' , '\n ' , 'everyone is different , but for me personally , i\xe2\x80\x99d rather people just ask about what happened rather than trying to conjure their own explanations .
 i am an open book , as i\xe2\x80\x99ve said multiple times .
 i\xe2\x80\x99d rather answer questions personally than have people get the wrong impression about my amputation.\n ' , '\n ' , 'people try to avoid awkward conversations and uncomfortable situations .
 i think that\xe2\x80\x99s normal .
 but there are ways to acknowledge these things without making a bigger deal out of it .
 the mother that i described could have simply told her kids that i had a prosthetic leg and let it at that .
 she could have said something that would allow her kids to know that disabilities and differences are to be celebrated , not shushed .
 instead of making her children feel like they did something wrong by asking about my leg , she could have been honest with them.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i am not trying to criticize the mom in the story , because i know that she was probably just trying to be sensitive to my feelings .
 i get that .
 i can be awkward around people who are different sometimes , too .
 but i use the story above to show that there are different ways to go about handling situations .
 i can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for everyone , but here are some things that i think would be helpful when encountering people with disabilities or people who look/talk/act differently from you : \n ' , '\n ' , '-treat people like humans , not problems or disabilities .
 underneath our metal legs and battle scars , we are all humans .
 we have emotions , thoughts , and lives just like you .
 treat us like you\xe2\x80\x99d treat anyone else.\n ' , '\xe2\x80\x93smile .
 a simple , non-condescending smile can go a long way.\n ' , '-don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of us !
 fake legs , wheelchairs , and machines are not scary monsters .
 they are simply necessities that help us to live the best life possible .
 don\xe2\x80\x99t fear what you do not know .
 seriously.\n ' , '\xe2\x80\x93if you are with kids and they ask questions , answer in a positive light .
 don\xe2\x80\x99t shut down their curiosity .
 rather than trying to silence them , give them some information .
 \xe2\x80\x9cthat girl uses a cool leg to walk .
 isn\xe2\x80\x99t it neat ? \xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cyes , she has a scar , but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful ? \xe2\x80\x9d\n ' , '\xe2\x80\x93don\xe2\x80\x99t make assumptions about our stories .
 if you want to know what happened , ask .
 don\xe2\x80\x99t try to tell your kids that someone was sick or something if you don\xe2\x80\x99t truly know the story .
 in the case of amputation , there are multiple reasons why someone could end up that way .
 some people are born without limbs .
 some were sick , while others had traumatic accidents .
 don\xe2\x80\x99t make up stories to explain our differences.\n ' , '-if you really want to know something , ask politely .
 some people are uncomfortable acknowledging the \xe2\x80\x9celephant in the room , \xe2\x80\x9d but the worst that will happen is they will tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99d rather not talk about it .
 trust me , you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not the first person to ask them a question .
 many people are happy to talk about it .
 just don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude with your words.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i am aware that this is an area where people don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do .
 i wish that weren\xe2\x80\x99t the case , since we\xe2\x80\x99re all humans and our level of ability shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cause such awkwardness , but that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is .
 the net time you see someone who is different than you , remember that they have a story .
 they have a life .
 they are a person who deserves to be respected , and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be uncomfortable around them .
 when in doubt , choose kindness and don\xe2\x80\x99t make assumptions .

 it has been a constant journey of trusting that everything will somehow work out , even when i don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what is happening in a given moment.\n ' , '\n ' , 'just when i start to get settled and comfortable , something happens to change up my plans .
 this has been particularly evident lately in my academic life .
 i think i know where i\xe2\x80\x99m going and what i want to do , and then\xe2\x80\x93bam\xe2\x80\x93something changes .
 i think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty normal for college students , though .
 most people change majors more than once , so i don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too abnormal about that .
 many people also change schools\xe2\x80\xa6which i also have done .
 but i think that part of my identity has been wrapped up in who i wanted to be and what i wanted to do in the future , which is why this newest change in my life has been necessary but difficult.\n ' , '\n ' , 'for the past few years , i have had a plan about my future career goals .
 i knew what i wanted to study , looked into different ways to get my degree , and thought everything was good to go .
 friends and family commented on how great of a career choice i had , and how wonderful it was that i would be getting my master\xe2\x80\x99s degree within the next few years .
 along the way , though , i\xe2\x80\x99ve hit several roadblocks , detours , and signs that maybe there was something else that i was supposed to do .
 my dreams were good , but maybe they weren\xe2\x80\x99t the best.\n ' , '\n ' , 'lately , i\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling a push to leave my desired major and take a different path .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s been a huge topic of discussion and debate , a process of weighing the pros and cons of going with the new plan that i feel led toward .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve done some research , talked to multiple people , and discussed things with the big man upstairs .
 although it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to push aside the ideal plans that i had made , it has become more clear that something else is up ahead .
 something that i don\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand right now , but that i hope will make more sense along the way.\n ' , '\n ' , 'as of this week , i\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to let go of my previous plans and go down a different road .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m switching majors and hoping to graduate next year rather than in three years .
 my identity will no longer be held in my career aspirations .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s something that i\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a sense of peace about , so this is the way i am choosing to go .
 i don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the future holds in terms of my education and career , but at least i have a start.\n ' , '\n ' , 'even though i feel peace about my decision , letting go of my plans is not easy .
 sometimes i think that i know what\xe2\x80\x99s best for my life , so i cling to my \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d plan .
 but in reality , i don\xe2\x80\x99t always know what\xe2\x80\x99s best .
 other people see things that i am blind to .
 i feel nudges about taking a different route .
 i do not always know the best way to live my life .
 even when it\xe2\x80\x99s challenging , i need to let go of my plans and let him take charge .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to seeing how this all plays out in the future.\n ' , '\n ' , 'posted in my life and tagged academic life , college , degree , education , faith , future , hope , letting go , life , major , my life , psychology , school , trust on may 18 , 2015 .
 1 comment\n ' , 'done with pt ! \n ' , 'guess what happened yesterday ?
 well , if you\xe2\x80\x99ve read the title , then you know\xe2\x80\xa6i had my last day of physical therapy !
 even though i\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss going over to the hospital on a regular basis , i\xe2\x80\x99m happy that i am well enough to leave behind the days of multiple appointments per week.\n ' , '\n ' , 'it\xe2\x80\x99s so encouraging to look back and see how far i\xe2\x80\x99ve come in the past 3 months or so since i received my leg and began pt .
 when i started therapy in february , i was still using both crutches .
 i did not trust my leg at all and i had a terrible limp .
 my knee wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to fully extend because of the contracture that had been present for so long .
 i occasionally tried to leave the crutches behind , but i always felt the need to go back to them for safety and stability .
 i remember my therapist telling me that it would take some time before i was able to walk unassisted .
 i so desperately wanted to jump ahead and be walking and running freely , but i knew that there was a process that i needed to go through first.\n ' , '\n ' , 'once i finally ditched the crutches about a month after starting therapy , i moved to a cane .
 i didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that very much , mostly because it made me feel too old .
 i used the cane occasionally , but tried to limp around without it .
 i still had some strengthening to do , but it was a huge step to leave the crutches behind.\n ' , '\n ' , 'finally , after deciding that my cane-using days were over , i began walking unassisted\xe2\x80\xa6all the time .
 my pt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very big into that idea at first because she knew that i still had some weakness that we needed to take care of , so i still used the cane in our sessions .
 gradually , i noticed that my trust in my leg increased and my limp decreased.\n ' , '\n ' , 'now , i only have a slight limp that most people probably don\xe2\x80\x99t notice .
 sure , it gets worse when i\xe2\x80\x99m tired or in pain , but for the most part , my muscles are strong and my body is stable .
 oh , and i\xe2\x80\x99ve regained almost all of the range of motion in my knee , which is a huge deal !
 i\xe2\x80\x99m able to walk , jog , hike , canoe , go to the beach\xe2\x80\xa6basically , i\xe2\x80\x99m free to do whatever i want !
 i have to wait a few months before i can talk to my doctor about getting a running leg , which i would love to have , and i might see about getting a swimming leg in the future .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m determined to enjoy life and push through as many so-called limits as possible ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'many thanks go out to the therapists at st. joe\xe2\x80\x99s , especially my pt , jenna .
 without her , i wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten this far .
 she helped me overcome my challenges , one wobbly step at a time .
 it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always easy , but every difficult session showed me how strong and capable my body is .
 i am so , so grateful to have my life back .
 not a day goes by that i don\xe2\x80\x99t think about how incredible it is that i am finally walking , driving , and in less pain than i have been in years .
 i say it all the time , but life is good .
 and i am grateful.\n ' , '\n ' , 'now , if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me , i need to start figuring out what to do with all this free time now that i have less appointments !
 haha , just kidding\xe2\x80\xa6my life is busy enough and my schedule is already filling up again : ) thanks for stopping by ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'posted in amputation and tagged amputee , amputee life , amputee rehab , health , hospital , journey , leg amputee , medical , my life , my story , physical rehab , physical therapy , pt , rbka , rehab , therapy on may 15 , 2015 .
 10 comments\n ' , 'mother\xe2\x80\x99s day\n ' , ' img_0976happy mother\xe2\x80\x99s day to all the wonderful moms , moms-to-be , and people who take on the role of a mom out there !
 it takes a special person to be a great mom .
 i am thankful to have an incredible mom who blesses me on a daily basis , and i could never thank her enough for all that she does for my family.\n ' , '\n ' , 'to those out there who struggle with this holiday for whatever reason , know that i am thinking about you especially today .
 i know people who have broken relationships or who are desperate to become a mom , and i am thinking about those brave women who have to watch as everyone else celebrates and changes their facebook profile photos or posts pictures of their mom on instagram .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m sure days like today only add salt to the wounds , but i hope and pray that better days are ahead and the holiday will soon be a reason for joy.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i believe that my mom deserves an extra bit of recognition today .
 it takes a fierce momma to deal with a kid who has a chronic illness .
 i don\xe2\x80\x99t think she looked at my face when i was born and envisioned countless nights on tiny hospital beds or endless days filled with worry .
 she never planned on having to watch as her daughter screamed bloody murder while she was forced to stand there , unable to help .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure she never imagined she\xe2\x80\x99d be sending her child across the country to the middle of the desert at age 15 , to nashville at age 16 , or to cleveland multiple times , all for lengthy stays with limited contact .
 in her dreams about becoming a mom , i\xe2\x80\x99m positive that rsd , eating disorders , or amputation never crossed her mind .
 she never signed up for any of this , and yet , that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99s had to deal with.\n ' , '\n ' , 'my mom has handled all of my issues with such love and grace .
 she has dealt with horrible doctors , crappy sleeping situations , distance from her family and other kids , and messy situations\xe2\x80\xa6all for me .
 she flew me all the way to arizona and had the courage to walk away from me , knowing that leaving her daughter in this unfamiliar place was what was necessary to save my life .
 when that place did its job as being \xe2\x80\x9clife support\xe2\x80\x9d temporarily but failed in the long run , she once again took me to a new state and said goodbye with tears in her eyes .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s not in a ( good ) mother\xe2\x80\x99s nature to be willing to send her children away , but she did it because she knew that that was what i needed .
 she sacrificed her own pain and heartache for the possibility that i would have a better life.\n ' , '\n ' , 'when i was told that i needed to have my leg amputated , my mom stood beside me .
 she is the one who insisted that my doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointment be moved up to an earlier date , and without that , i very well could have died from the infection that was invading my body .
 she agreed to support me in my decision to make it a positive experience .
 i can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to watch your daughter being wheeled into an operating room , knowing that she\xe2\x80\x99ll come out with a missing limb , but she let the doctors do their job .
 she\xe2\x80\x99s been the best amputee momma out there , supporting me through it all.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i can\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine the amount of time my mom has spent praying for me , crying for me , and worrying about me .
 she had to deal with my anger and harsh words toward her when i was writhing in pain , both physically and emotionally .
 she had to listen as i screamed and shouted about how much i wished i were dead , and she often had to go against my own ( unhealthy ) wishes because she knew what was best for me.\n ' , '\n ' , 'my mom has been through so much but she continues to embrace life with a smile .
 rather than giving up when things got tough , she pressed on and has served as an encouragement and inspiration to those around her .
 she always reminds me how much i am loved and how proud she is to be my mom , even when i\xe2\x80\x99ve put her through hell and back .
 i will never fully fathom how strong she is and the deepness of her love and sacrifice for my family.\n ' , '\n ' , 'happy mother\xe2\x80\x99s day , momma .
 i look forward to so many more memories and fun times together in the future .
 keep up the good work , because you are one outstanding woman .

 10 comments\n '' , 'flying as an amputee\n ' , 'processed with moldivlast week , i took a trip to delaware to spend some time with my brother and our awesome family friends .
 it was the first time that i had flown since my amputation , so i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t completely sure what to expect .
 with the heightened security these days , i wondered if i\xe2\x80\x99d be hassled about my leg .\n ' , '\n ' , 'we arrived at the airport in the evening , so things were relatively empty .
 i was wearing shorts so that the tsa agents could easily identify me as an amputee .
 ( i figured that\xe2\x80\x99d be better than sliding through the metal detector and beeping . )
 when one of the workers noticed my leg , she told me to step into the full-body scanner .
 she was very friendly , commenting on my sparkly shoes ( which she let me keep on ) and asking about my travel adventures .
 after a few swipes of a warm cloth over my hands and prosthetic leg to check for anything suspicious , i was cleared to go to my gate.\n ' , '\n ' , 'it was so nice to travel without crutches for the first time in years .
 i used to struggle with getting on the plane and finding a spot for my aluminum sidekicks .
 this time , it was just me and my leg , which was securely fastened to my body .
 i opted to forego pre boarding since i consider myself to be as able-bodied as anyone else .
 when our zone was called , we headed to our seats and sat down.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i was very happy with how smoothly things went during my trip .
 after having some not-so-pleasant flying experiences in the past , this felt like a breeze .
 the flight attendants played movie trivia with us while we waited to depart , and the flight was comfortable.\n ' , '\n ' , 'on the way home , security was more strict ( i had to take off my shoes , which is a pain\xe2\x80\xa6but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay ) but i didn\xe2\x80\x99t have too many issues .
 i was once again scanned , swiped , and sent on my way .
 i had no problems getting to my gate or boarding the plane.\n ' , '\n ' , 'if you\xe2\x80\x99re flying as an amputee , here are some tips that i think helped my experience : \n ' , '\n ' , '-wear shorts/short-sleeved shirts ( depending on where your amputation happened ) so that you can be easily identified as an amputee .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s much better than making the metal detector go crazy !
 plus , it is easier for the tsa agents to access your prosthetic ( if you have one ) so that they can test it for any harmful substances.\n ' , '-wear shoes that are easy to remove .
 if you are a lower limb amputee with a prosthetic leg such as myself , you may have to take off your shoes .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s better to wear comfortable shoes that you can quickly take on and off.\n ' , '-if you have the option , don\xe2\x80\x99t wear too many socks .
 your limbs tend to swell a bit while flying , so if you have too many socks on your limb , you may feel uncomfortable tightness.\n ' , '-relax and enjoy your time ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'i love to travel , and it is such a relief to know that flying as an amputee isn\xe2\x80\x99t as complicated as i once thought .
 i look forward to future adventures now that i am confident in both my leg and my ability to travel without major issues ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'posted in amputation , uncategorized and tagged adventure , amputation , amputee , amputee air travel , amputee travel , flying as an amputee , flying with a prosthesis , life , my life , prosthetic , travel , tsa on may 9 , 2015 .
 2 comments\n ' , 'just for today\n ' , ' img_1188each day gives us 24 hours .
 sometimes we wish for more time to get things done , but there are other times when we aren\xe2\x80\x99t even sure if we can make it through the day without a breakdown .
 at least that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is for me .
 but regardless of what happens , each day only has 24 hours.\n ' , '\n ' , 'at a recent meeting that i attended , someone shared about the 5 principles of reiki .
 aside from doing some quick research on this practice when i was talked into trying it while in the hospital a few years back , i didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about it .
 i still don\xe2\x80\x99t , really , and i didn\xe2\x80\x99t find it to be an effective healing technique in my personal situation .
 regardless of the ins and outs of reiki , i appreciated the content of the 5 principles that were shared : \n ' , '\n ' , 'just for today , i will not anger.\n ' , 'just for today , i will not worry.\n ' , 'just for today , i will be honest.\n ' , 'just for today , i will be grateful.\n ' , 'just for today , i will be compassionate toward myself and others.\n ' , '\n ' , 'as i\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through the past few weeks , i have reflected on these principles .
 am i refraining from anger ?
 am i allowing my faith to be bigger than my fear ?
 am i being honest ?
 am i taking time to show my gratitude and appreciation , even for the little things ?
 am i giving myself the grace that i need and being compassionate toward others ?
 it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be mindful of our actions so that we know how to improve.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i believe that these are five important things that can be difficult at times , but really have the power to change our mindset .
 by focusing on one day at a time , they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem as tough to accomplish .
 just for today , you can keep going .
 just for today , you can choose to be positive .
 just for today , you can remember that there is life to be lived .
 tomorrow has its own worries , but just for today , you can handle what\xe2\x80\x99s in front of you .
 and with each new day , you can start fresh with the idea that something wonderful is going to happen .
 even the darkest moments can have glimmers of light if you take the time to look closely and choose to see things through eyes of gratitude and positivity .
 just for today\xe2\x80\xa6you can be strong and hold on.\n ' , '\n ' , 'posted in my life and tagged compassion , gratitude , honesty , hope , life , mindfulness , mindset , my life , peace , positive , principles of reiki , reiki , thoughts , today on may 3 , 2015 .
 5 comments\n ' , 'limb loss awareness month\n ' , ' processed with moldivhow is it almost may ? !
 before time slips away any faster , i figured i should squeeze in a post about why april is an important month .
 do you know what\xe2\x80\x99s special about this month of the year ?
 ( well , besides the birds chirping , warmer temperatures , and the anticipation of summer . )
 in case you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already caught on from my post title and the featured image , april is limb loss awareness month ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'last april , i had no clue that it was such a significant month for awareness .
 amputation , in my mind , was never going to become a personal experience .
 but now that i\xe2\x80\x99m an amputee ?
 i see april as a way to celebrate life and spread awareness about taking care of your limbs so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go through the terrifying wonderful process of joining the amputee club.\n ' , '\n ' , 'here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal : chances are , you\xe2\x80\x99ll never even have to think about becoming an amputee .
 i mean , most people make it through life with all their limbs intact .
 however , bodies are funny and life is strange , and you never know when you or a loved one may become a potential amputee.\n ' , '\n ' , 'each day , more than 500 americans become amputees .
 ( statistic from the amputee coalition ) that seems like a lot , right ?
 to me it does .
 there are numerous causes for peoples\xe2\x80\x99 amputations , some which are preventable .
 regardless of the cause , with so many people becoming amputees daily , awareness about amputation is important.\n ' , '\n ' , 'why is awareness important ?
 well , first of all , many people do not know how to react to amputees .
 parents tell their kids not to stare .
 people shy away from the subject .
 sometimes the fact that someone is different brings up questions or awkwardness and people don\xe2\x80\x99t know how what to do .
 now that i am on the other side of things , i realize that each amputee has been on a unique journey to get to where they are .
 some want to forget that it ever happened , while others are completely fine with their amputation .
 either way , amputees should be treated like the normal human beings that they ( we ) are .
 we\xe2\x80\x99re not aliens or robots just because we may have metal limbs !
 our differences don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be scary.\n ' , '\n ' , 'awareness is also important because many times , amputation can be prevented with proper care .
 we\xe2\x80\x99re only given one body while we\xe2\x80\x99re here on this earth , so it is critical that we take care of ourselves .
 making positive lifestyle choices can help avoid health problems .
 becoming aware of changes in our bodies is also important so that issues can be resolved before they spiral out of control .
 take me for example .
 if i would\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to the doctor when i first noticed signs of my limb breaking down instead of waiting until things became irreversible , then i might not have ended up where i am today .
 my fear of doctors kept me from seeking help , but now i know that the right doctors will do anything they can to make sure their patients\xe2\x80\x99 needs are taken care of.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i am a proud amputee and i am grateful for how far i\xe2\x80\x99ve come since my surgery five months ago .
 i hope that as awareness increases , my fellow amputees will realize that they are not alone .
 amputation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to mean isolation or the end of a happy , fulfilling life .
 i also hope that non-amputees will realize that amputees are just like anybody else , and there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to fear what you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand .
 if you have any questions about the amputee life , know that you can always ask me !
 i love telling people about my journey and spreading awareness about amputation.\n ' , '\n ' , 'as i heard many times this weekend as i sat in the audience of shrek , jr. , what makes us special makes us strong .
 let\xe2\x80\x99s embrace our differences and celebrate life together.\n ' , '\n ' , 'posted in amputation and tagged amputation , amputee , amputee awareness , amputee coalition , amputee life , awareness , health , healthy , humans , life , limb loss awareness , living , medical on april 27 , 2015 .
 2 comments\n ' , '5 months & a 5k ! \n ' , 'five months ago today , i was sleeping in my hospital room after having my leg amputated .
 my doctors weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure how well i would recover from surgery .
 would i walk again ?
 surely i\xe2\x80\x99d be in pain , they thought .
 my leg guy didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if i\xe2\x80\x99d be able to wear a prosthesis because of my issues with sensitivity .
 my medical team all thought that maybe i\xe2\x80\x99d walk , but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure if i\xe2\x80\x99d be able to do more than that.\n ' , '\n ' , 'this morning , exactly 5 months after surgery , my dad and i drove to the hospital where my leg was removed .
 this time , instead of being in a boring hospital gown with tubes hanging from my body , i was sporting a snazzy `` join me '' shirt and a race bib .
 in place of my old bandages that were once wrapped around my limb , i was proudly showing off my new leg .
 on the campus of the hospital where i once broke down sobbing over the idea of losing my leg , i was preparing to participate in a 5k.\n ' , '\n ' , 'my dad and i were joined by our awesome friends who have walked alongside me during the past few years of my crazy journey .
 it was great to have dee and her kids with us because they have been so encouraging to me , both before and after my surgery .
 i watch the kids every week , and they were a big reason why i was motivated to get up and walk again\xe2\x80\x93i wanted to be able to play outside and do fun things with them !
 it felt like things were coming around full circle\xe2\x80\x93after going through the darkest storm , the clouds had finally cleared and i was enjoying freedom while being surrounded by incredible people.\n ' , '\n ' , 'processed with moldiv\n ' , ' { together we will run } \n ' , '\n ' , 'after doing our warmups and laughing at how many times the instructor talked about ankle mobility , noting the fact that i can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly move my right ankle on my own , we waved to the drone in the air and began the race .
 it was hard for me to believe that i was actually participating in a 5k .
 i did one a few years ago , but i figured that with my health issues , that would be the one and only race i\xe2\x80\x99d ever be able to do .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m glad that i can now add another race to the list , with hopes of doing many more in the future .
 my leg isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly built for running ( i get to talk to my leg guy and doctor about getting one of those in september ) , so most of the time was spent walking .
 i tried to jog a bit but i think it looked more like a beginner\xe2\x80\x99s irish jig than a graceful run .
 that\xe2\x80\x99s okay , though , because i was just happy to be moving ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'never in my wildest dreams did i imagine that i\xe2\x80\x99d be doing this well right now .
 before surgery , i had gone through a bit of an acceptance phase when i realized that i probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get better .
 people said i\xe2\x80\x99d never walk again , which meant that running was far out of the realm of possibilities .
 never say never , right ?
 today , as i ran across the finish line , i celebrated the fact that i was able to finally prove them wrong .
 i am hoping that this is just the beginning of a new , active lifestyle .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m grateful for where i am right now and i am trying to enjoy every moment , knowing all too well how things can change suddenly .
 ( of course , i\xe2\x80\x99m not expecting anything bad to happen , but i plan on living my life to the fullest as long as i can .
 ) \n ' , '\n ' , 'a 5k may not seem like a big deal , but for the girl who spent 2.5 years on crutches , it was a miracle .
 thanks for the fun , st. joe\xe2\x80\x99s !

 13 comments\n ' , 'who\xe2\x80\x99s on my team ? \n ' , 'when you become an amputee , you are basically forced to interact with several medical professionals .
 besides the obvious people who are there when your surgery first happens , you develop a team of people who have different roles in your care after you go home .
 i find myself at the hospital at least twice a week because of all the appointments i get to go to .
 soon , the frequency of my visits will lower , but for now i am enjoying the time i get to spend at st. joe\xe2\x80\x99s.\n ' , '\n ' , 'so\xe2\x80\xa6who\xe2\x80\x99s on my post-op care team ?
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten some questions about how my appointments have been going , and when/where they happen .
 here are some of the amazing people who have helped me get to where i am today : \n ' , '\n ' , 'vascular surgeon ( aka dr .
 hero ) : he\xe2\x80\x99s the one who chopped my leg off .
 before surgery , i was in his office multiple times per week to see a wonderful nurse for dressing changes .
 now , my visits are more spread out\xe2\x80\x93in fact , the next time i see him won\xe2\x80\x99t be until july !

 my leg guy makes adjustments to my leg and casts me for new sockets when needed .
 i\xe2\x80\x99m getting my leg laminated in a few weeks , so it\xe2\x80\x99ll look better than it does right now .

 really , it is !
 it\xe2\x80\x99s so exciting to look at how much progress i\xe2\x80\x99ve made each week .
 i see my physical therapist twice a week , and we do a lot of strengthening exercises ( leg press , resistance bands , etc ) among other things .
 we are currently working hard to get rid of my limp , which means my muscles need to get stronger !
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve met most of my goals , so i only have a few pt visits left .

 [ 'real life minimalists : conrad\n ' , 'by miss minimalist | 11 comments\n ' , 'pin it\n ' , 'every monday i post real life minimalists , a profile of one of my readers in their own words .
 if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to participate , click here for details.\n ' , '\n ' , 'this week , conrad tells us about the pared-down lifestyle he and his wife enjoy aboard their boat .
 i love how he describes time as \xe2\x80\x9cthe great equalizer , \xe2\x80\x9d and shares how his minimalism helps him make the most of it .
 please visit his blog to learn more.\n ' , '\n ' , 'conrad writes : \n ' , '\n ' , 'conrad and roxanne\n ' , 'conrad and roxanne\n ' , 'living in a country where bigger is synonymous with better , being a minimalist is a title my wife and i often kept to ourselves .
 even the coolest slogans encourage upsizing : \xe2\x80\x9cgo big or go home\xe2\x80\x9d , \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is bigger in texas\xe2\x80\x9d , \xe2\x80\x9cdream big\xe2\x80\x9d , \xe2\x80\x9cspeak softly and carry a big stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\n ' , '\n ' , 'becoming a minimalist seemed like a step in the wrong direction.\n ' , '\n ' , 'but taking steps to minimalize our possessions allowed us to maximize our quality of life .
 three years ago we quit our jobs , sold our house , furniture , cars and 99 % of our possessions .
 we then bought a boat ( we paid cash , no more debt for us ) and moved aboard.\n ' , '\n ' , 'now we live in some of the most picturesque marinas surrounded by million dollar views and million dollar homes .
 the marina\xe2\x80\x99s supply the internet access , pay for the water , provide for garbage service and lease us a slip to park our boat all for under $ 300 per month.\n ' , '\n ' , 'our 49\xe2\x80\xb2 motor yacht ( purchase price , less than $ 50,000 ) became the perfect minimalist home for us .
 there is no need to outfit it with furniture , the furniture is already built into the boat .
 when we moved aboard it was like walking into a furnished home .
 the couches , end tables , lamps , beds , chest of drawers were already there .
 the couple we bought the boat from even left all of the pots , pans , dishes and silverware .
 we literally could have moved our clothes and laptops aboard and been 95 % moved in.\n ' , '\n ' , 'then we created an internet consulting business .
 since our bills were very minimal we didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to make a lot of money ( less than $ 2,000/month at first ) .
 my previous job\xe2\x80\x99s hour long morning commute had transformed into a 20 foot walk , usually still wearing my pajamas and sipping on hot coffee .
 we have no need for two cars because we work from the boat .
 we don\xe2\x80\x99t drive much so we don\xe2\x80\x99t spend much on gas .
 the tires need changing less often and we only need to pay insurance on one car .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s a real eye opener when you add up all of the expenses that are directly associated to having a job.\n ' , '\n ' , 'though we make half the money of our previous lives we have double the disposable income .
 but where we really go big with being minimalist is the life experiences that we can now enjoy .
 we no longer need to work 40 or 50 hours per week .
 often times i am finished working by noon and i take off even earlier on fridays .
 my wife and i have spent our extra time visiting coastal cities , learning to play the guitar , finishing her college degree , learning to speak spanish , writing books , taking the dogs on long walks and learning the tango .
 daily we literally have hours to use as we please.\n ' , '\n ' , 'time , to me , is the only commodity in life that has real value .
 it\xe2\x80\x99s the great equalizer and the most democratic of all things .
 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you are rich or poor , famous or anonymous , black or white , fat or thin or any other differentiator that exists in the world .
 we all wake up each day with the same amount of time .
 we all have 24 hours to spend as we see fit.\n ' , '\n ' , 'the question my wife and i asked ourselves 3 years ago was , \xe2\x80\x9cdo we really want to spend all of our time at work so we can buy things we don\xe2\x80\x99t really need ? \xe2\x80\x9d\n ' , '\n ' , 'yeah we\xe2\x80\x99re minimalist when it comes to possessions but when it comes to getting the most out of life , we\xe2\x80\x99re maximalist ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in our whole story , check out our book , \xe2\x80\x9cown less & live more : a sailing adventure that takes you from the cubicle to key west.\xe2\x80\x9d\n ' , '\n ' , ' { if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more about minimalist living , please consider reading my book , the joy of less , a minimalist living guide , or subscribing to my rss feed .

 [ 'date : 5/28/2015\r\n ' , 'site : http : //mishaandmia.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-i-made-my-own-wedding-dress.html\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'sunday , 18 november 2012\r\n ' , 'how i made my own wedding dress \r\n ' , 'i had never made any dresses , skirts , tops or pants before .
 as a matter of fact , i had never made any single clothing item in my life .
 i do have a sewing machine and have been sewing totes and making small alterations but that\ 's as far as my sewing experience goes .
 this is my short journal of how i made my own wedding dress ( with my mom\ 's help ) in two weeks without a pattern or any experience in dress making.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '4 months before the wedding\r\n ' , 'we set the date for the wedding and i tell misha that i want to make my own wedding dress .
 he is shocked , to say the least .
 he very gently points out that me making my own dress might be overly ambitious .
 i think he just wants to make it easy on me but i know it can be done .
 instead of wasting my time searching for the one dress , i can just make it exactly the way i want it and save time and money .
 it would be a sharp learning curve ; like being in a sewing bootcamp .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '7 weeks before the wedding \r\n ' , 'i finally start planning for the dress .
 i start researching and figuring out what type of dress i would like and how i am going to make it .
 i love long , flowing ball gowns made from natural light fabrics .
 i also like romantic lace tops and delicate veils .
 i make this little sketch of what i envision .
 i realize how much it resembles the princesses i used to draw as a little girl.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'wedding dress sketch\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '6 weeks before the wedding\r\n ' , 'still searching for online inspiration .
 i find this image and love the rich pleated skirt and wide belt .
 i love how light , crisp and full it looks .
 i think i found the look for the skirt.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'amsale wedding dress - see source\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '5 weeks before the wedding\r\n ' , 'it\ 's time to make my sample dress .
 i pick up 8 metres of cheap muslin and search out a you-tube tutorial on pattern making .
 i find this great lesson on couture draping on a dress stand .
 http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=rkppkqeyxg4 & feature=related .
 i follow the instructions to the dot and create a sample bodice for my measurements .
 it fits perfectly .
 i am impressed .
 i really get into it and make a sample skirt as well , but i am not that happy with it .
 the skirt skirt will need more fabric to make it fuller.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '4 weeks before the wedding\r\n ' , 'i am having a moment .
 i tell misha that we might have to cancel the wedding .
 the dress is not coming together .
 he laughs and tries to be supportive .
 i lighten up as well.\r\n ' , 'i get back to sewing and remake the skirt by adding more fabric to it .
 it looks fuller now .
 i am optimistic again.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '3 weeks before the wedding \r\n ' , 'mom arrives and i am relieved to have her with me .
 her sewing experience is invaluable .
 she learned to sew from my grandmother who was a seamstress .
 i look forward to working with her on the dress and getting some century old sewing tips .
 this is becoming a family tradition ; my grandmother helped make my mother\ 's dress.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '2 and a half weeks before the wedding\r\n ' , `` it 's time to have some fun .
 mom and i are going fabric shopping to queen st. west .
 we admire the amazing assortment of luxurious fabrics .
 lace , silk and velvet are stacked to the ceiling .
 we are in paradise ! \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we buy 1 1/2 metres of french lace .
 it is very expensive but a must .
 i could have gotten away with less but wanted to be on the safe side .
 for the skirt and a short sleeve bodice we buy 6 metres of silk dupioni .
 gorgeous fabric !
 happy about going with ivory instead of bright white .
 gives it a nice soft , vintage feel.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '14 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'mom and i officially begin working on the dress .
 i keep calling it a dress but it\ 's actually a two piece .
 making it as a two piece makes our life much easier .
 i start with the skirt .
 it goes well and i finish it in a day .
 i have high hopes for finishing everything in a few days .
 hm ... if i only knew ... \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '13 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'i watch several \'how to\ ' videos and start working on the petticoat .
 i want the skirt to be big and puffy , which means a lot of crinoline for the underskirt .
 we soon run out of crinoline and misha drives us to fabricland .
 luckily , it\ 's five minutes from our house .
 we have no time to waste.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' petticoat in making\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '12 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'still working on the petticoat .
 i am sewing on layers and layers of crinoline .
 the skirt is still not full enough .
 let\ 's add another line of frills.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we do another fabricland run .
 i pick up a half metre of beige faux fur for the shawl wrap we want to make .
 it\ 's fall after all and i like being warm , even on my wedding day.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '10 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'taking it easy .
 the petticoat is coming together .
 i am feeling very optimistic.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' petticoat almost done\r\n ' , '8 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'it\ 's a beautiful fall day .
 we take the day off and get out of the house to check out a local organic market .
 i am surprised how relaxed we are with the wedding in a week and no dress yet.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '7 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'it\ 's time to tackle the top .
 we start with the sleeveless silk bodice .
 we use the muslin sample top as a pattern .
 it\ 's not going smoothly .
 we are having some trouble fitting it well.\r\n ' , 'misha keeps asking how the dress is coming along .
 i think he is starting to get worried.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '6 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'the top is giving us more headaches than we thought .
 the lace is very difficult to work with .
 it doesn\'t fit well with the silk bodice .
 we are being patient and still don\'t panic .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '5 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'tragedy strikes !
 i slip and fall on the back porch steps and spend the evening at the er .
 the outcome is a fractured elbow .
 luckily no nerve or muscle damage .
 my whole left arm gets a cast .
 not good timing ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'while i am in the er mom finishes the shawl wrap .
 it looks beautiful ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '4 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'work must go on and i am handling the sewing machine with one hand .
 mom is doing all the hand stitching .
 i can\'t be more grateful .
 she is amazing ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'sewing with a cast on\r\n ' , 'the dress has to be adjusted to my full arm cast .
 the left sleeve is cut short .
 we also keep the side open so i can put the top on .
 i am also thinking of covering the cast with some leftover silk fabric .
 at least it will match.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '2 days before the wedding\r\n ' , 'we are frantically trying to finish the dress .
 the bodice still doesn\'t fit well .
 trying it on with the cast is also a nightmare .
 my arm hurts a lot when i lift it .
 \r\n ' , `` misha stopped asking how the dressmaking is going .
 i think he 's got the picture.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '1 day before the wedding\r\n ' , 'the dress is still missing some snaps and hooks and the silk cast cover is not done .
 mom is finishing up the veil .
 i am going to sleep at midnight .
 i am exhausted.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '45 minutes before the wedding\r\n ' , 'my hair and make up is done and i am all dressed .
 a friend is stitching together the silk cast cover on me .
 we have 15 minutes to go .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '30 minutes before the wedding\r\n ' , 'the dress is ready .
 i am ready .
 the show is on .
 let\ 's get married ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'and we live happily ever after.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '3 weeks after the wedding\r\n ' , 'still waiting for the official wedding pictures but here are pictures of the dress on the stand .

 [ 'date : 5/28/2015\r\n ' , 'site : http : //boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2014/10/some-thoughts-about-moving-to-new.html\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'thursday , october 23 , 2014\r\n ' , 'some thoughts about moving to a new country ( and packing for it ) \r\n ' , 'as i enjoy my last day in d\xc3\xbcsseldorf , there are lots of thoughts going through my head .
 i remember the first time i moved abroad back in 2005 as a college student -- i actually sobbed to my mother for three hours .
 maybe more .
 i recall wailing to her , `` but why am i even going abroad ? !
 i feel comfortable where i am and i like it here ! !
 what am i doing ? ! ? ''
 nine years later , eight of which have been spent outside the u.s. , i can only laugh at my college self and think , `` how cute . ''
 because honestly , i wouldn\'t change the last nine years at all.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` i have the feeling that in shanghai , i will constantly be comparing it to my german experience .
 i realize though that this is unfair .
 d\xc3\xbcsseldorf consistently ranks in the top 10 most livable cities in europe , if not the world , according to the mercer quality of living survey .
 on the other hand , china ranks as the number one country for expats according to the bbc .
 but does living as an expat actually mean a good quality of life ?
 i do n't think it necessarily does , but this will probably be one of the bigger questions i answer in china.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'one thing that worries me about living in china is being chinese-american , but my mandarin is only so-so .
 of course , i\ 'm eager to improve it , but there is an expectation that if you look asian , you speak the local language .
 it\ 's a common problem in asia that i encountered in beijing , tokyo , and kyoto .
 the attitude is , `` why don\'t you speak the local language ?
 you\ 're asian ! ''
 this video sums up my experience really well : \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i actually finished packing today and i must say , i\ 'm either getting really good at this moving-abroad-for-a-year-thing or i\ 'm forgetting something .
 ( this is the third time i\ 've moved abroad for a year -- once going to berlin , once with my cbyx year ) i managed to pack one big suitcase that weighs 19.6 kilograms ( about 43 pounds ) with everything i think i need in it .
 i\ 've realized that i wear the same stuff over and over again anyway , so if the thought crossed my mind , `` maybe i should pack that because i might actually wear it , '' the item got left behind .
 this is what my clothing looked like just laying it out in the living room living room : \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'whenever it comes to larger trips like this ( or rather , just moving temporarily ) , i take a look at what i want to bring .
 i considered actually making a chart of how many different combinations i could make -- which pants would go with what top and if i could match a jacket or cardigan to it , plus shoes .
 i didn\'t actually wind up making a chart , but i do take that into consideration .
 anything that is too specific and can\'t be combined with anything else doesn\'t get packed .
 the only exception is a cocktail dress , which was the dead giveaway that i\ 'm not a student anymore .
 i actually am bringing it because i thought , `` well , if i get invited to a wedding ... or something ... i don\'t feel like shopping . ''
 as a student , bringing a cocktail dress never even crossed my mind.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'after laying it out in the neatly , i rolled everything up .
 i find that rolling everything saves a lot more space and you can cram smaller things like t-shirts into gaps easier than when it\ 's folded .
 not only that , but i think my clothes also arrive less wrinkled when rolled .
 i could be wrong on this , but it\ 's just a feeling .
 anyhow , i can definitely fit more rolling everything and if i had actually packed my boots in the photo rather than wearing them , i would stuff them with clothes too .
 plus , everything looks more manageable and less scary : \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'with the shoes , i packed two pairs of heels , two pairs of boots , two pairs of casual shoes , and my running sneakers .
 the heels had to be versatile ; i can wear them dressed for more formal occasions like putting them with the cocktail dress , but they also had to be not too flashy so i could wear them for work .
 the boots are very different from each other ; as you can see , i have a pair of knee-highs and then ankle boots .
 again , they\ 're different from each other but can be worn with a lot of different outfits .
 as for the casual shoes , they don\'t take up much space , but i like having different pairs for city trips .
 and the running sneakers are for the gym ( i don\'t run outside and can\'t imagine doing so in shanghai ) .
 generally , i took the largest items and decided that that\ 's what i\ 'll wear on the plane .
 so it\ 's the knee-high boots , a hoodie , a pair of jeans , shirt , and leather jacket .
 it saves the space in my bag .\r\n ' , '.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'finally , after i\ 've evaluated everything rolled up , it all goes into the suitcase : \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'like i said , everything gets crammed into little spaces .
 shoes are packed like they would be in a box so they\ 're as narrow as possible .
 i\ 've stuck a bunch of flat things in the front pockets of the luggage .
 everything i packed managed to fit and then some , so i added one or two extra t-shirts , but left the extra sweaters out .
 if i were moving to a much colder place , i\ 'd consider more warmer weather clothing , but considering i layer everything ( tank tops / t-shirts with a sweater ) , it also makes everything more efficient.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i started writing this yesterday , but now it\ 's 6:45 in the morning .
 i woke up early so i know i\ 'll be able to fall asleep on the plane .
 i could definitely use some more sleep , but i also had to make sure my carry-on and personal items are ready to go .
 and they are .
 so let\ 's hope that i haven\'t forgotten anything super important .
 if i did , then it probably wasn\'t actually super important because i wouldn\'t have forgotten it in the first place.\r\n ' , 'posted by plee at 6:47 am \r\n ' , 'labels : china , germany , packing , shanghai ' ]

 \r\n ' , 'i think that it is because my journey of being a bone marrow donor \r\n ' , 'and helping save my brother\xe2\x80\x99s life has touched me so deeply and had such an impact on me .
 \r\n ' , 'this experience has changed my perspective on life , so much so that i had to give it some time.\r\n ' , 'time for me to wrap my head around what had taken place and what my brother and i had gone through , \r\n ' , ' and time to heal , not only physically but emotionally.\r\n ' , 'it is all still so tender and my feelings are so close to the surface \r\n ' , 'that i still have trouble telling the story without crying .
 \r\n ' , 'crying mostly happy , joyful tears .
 \r\n ' , 'joy in the knowledge that we have a heavenly father who loves us , \r\n ' , 'who is keenly aware of each and everyone of us and the trials that we are going through.\r\n ' , ' below is an instagram that i posted early one morning on our drive to the hospital.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'these were the thoughts that came to my mind as i saw the beautiful sunrise that morning .
 \r\n ' , 'little did i know that the words that i wrote that morning , \r\n ' , 'the love that i felt that my heavenly father had for me and my brother would truly be what i held on to \r\n ' , 'and what kept me going through an intense time during this journey \r\n ' , 'and probably one of the scariest moments of my life .
 \r\n ' , 'throughout this experience i have felt our saviors love , as if his arms were wrapped around me .
 \r\n ' , 'he gave me the strength to do something wonderful , something remarkable\r\n ' , ' but probably one of the hardest things that i\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done in my life , \r\n ' , 'and for that i am truly humbled and ever so grateful \r\n ' , 'that the opportunity to be my brother , eric\xe2\x80\x99s bone marrow donor was given to me .
 \r\n ' , 'with that i will begin the story.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'getting the phone call and hearing the words \xe2\x80\x9ceric has bone cancer\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , 'took me by surprise and seemed almost impossible for me to comprehend.\r\n ' , ' it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense .
 my brother eric , who had just turned 59 , has always been physically fit .
 \r\n ' , `` he 's an avid hiker , who swims every morning for an hour and then walks at lunchtime for another hour .
 \r\n '' , 'he is the perfect picture of healthy and the last person i would think would ever have cancer .
 \r\n ' , 'being healthy and physically fit and the fact that they caught it early proved to be a blessing\r\n ' , ' so as hard as it was to hear that he had cancer , \r\n ' , 'we felt good going forward as he begun fighting for his life .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it was the end of may when eric was first diagnosed \r\n ' , 'and he immediately begun an aggressive series of chemo to treat the cancer .
 \r\n ' , ' within a few weeks his health quickly declined , he was experiencing an enormous amount of pain \r\n ' , 'and it was determined that he would need a bone marrow transplant to save his life .
 \r\n ' , 'since there are 6 siblings that could be possible candidates , \r\n ' , ' we felt confident that one , if not a couple of us would be a \xe2\x80\x9cmatch.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , 'all of my brothers and sisters were going to be in utah for the 4th of july \r\n ' , 'so they were able to go in person to be tested in person at the lds hospital.\r\n ' , ' i was told that a kit would be sent to me via the mail so i waited for the kit to arrive.\r\n ' , ' one by one the results came back and not one of my siblings was a \xe2\x80\x9cmatch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n ' , ' i was still waiting for my kit to arrive and i felt anxious about the situation that was unfolding .
 \r\n ' , 'my brother was so sick and in so much pain that things looked grim .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'on my birthday , july 11th , my brother called to wish me a happy birthday .
 \r\n ' , 'he sounded so weak that i hardly recognized his voice .
 he tried to be upbeat \r\n ' , 'but told me that if i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that he could hold on long enough\r\n ' , ' to find a match from the national registry , which would take an additional 6-8 weeks .
 \r\n ' , 'i was shocked to her my brother sound so discouraged .
 \r\n ' , 'he is one of the most determined , hard working , `` never give up '' kind of guys that i\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met .
 \r\n ' , ' i felt so much pressure and was determined that i was the one that would be his `` match . ''
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'earlier in the day , my dear friend karen hosted a birthday luncheon\r\n ' , ' with a few dear friends which included a yummy birthday cake.\r\n ' , 'when it was time to blow out the candle , i thought of my brother \r\n ' , 'and decided that i would wish that i would be the \xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d that he so desperately needed.\r\n ' , ' as much as it scared me to go through the procedure of donating my bone marrow , \r\n ' , 'it didn\xe2\x80\x99t compare to the fear of losing my brother .
 \r\n ' , ' fortunately , i was able to blow out my candle ( thanks karen , for only putting one candle on my cake ! )
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' i was happy to share my birthday wish with my brother\r\n ' , ' and told him how i truly hoped and prayed that i would be a `` match.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , 'i have never prayed so hard , along with so many others , that i would be his \xe2\x80\x9cmatch.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , 'that was thursday and my kit didn\'t arrived until monday morning.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i had a feeling that the kit would come on monday so i didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat or drink anything that morning .
 \r\n ' , 'i was tending three little kids for my friend , while she was at a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointment \r\n ' , 'and by the time she came and picked the kids up , my mouth was so dry and i was dying of thirst .
 \r\n ' , 'those of you who know me , know what a sacrifice this is for me to go without my diet pepsi .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'a group of my friends usually gather at my house every monday to sew and quilt.\r\n ' , 'my friend , julie coyle , came over right when the kit arrived at my door that morning .
 \r\n ' , ' the kit included a vial which i was instructed to collect about 1 tablespoon of my saliva in .
 \r\n ' , ' that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound too hard but my throat was so dry \r\n ' , 'and i apologized to julie as she was sitting across the table , trying to sew , \r\n ' , 'as i was busy trying to spit into the tube .
 \r\n ' , 'julie , of course , was great !
 she was cheering me on , \xe2\x80\x9ccome on , debbie !
 you can do this ! \xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , 'i love and so appreciated julie\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm as she encouraged me until at last i had collected enough saliva .
 \r\n ' , ' i closed the vial and shook it up , carefully labeled it and threw it into the prepaid envelope .
 \r\n ' , ' julie insisted that we get it in the mail and with that we jumped into her car and headed straight to the post office .
 \r\n ' , ' after dropping the envelope in the mailbox , we celebrated by grabbing lunch at la bou .
 \r\n ' , ' i love that julie coyle , and every time i think about her cheering me on and encouraging me to spit , i get the giggles ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it was a long week waiting for the results , although i prayed every night and day that i would be the match , \r\n ' , ' by the time the next monday rolled around , i had almost forgot all about it.\r\n ' , ' when i picked up a call that morning and greta , the bone marrow transplant coordinator at the lds in salt lake , \r\n ' , 'was on the other end of the line , it caught me off gaurd , and then i realized ... this is it ... and i sat down and braced myself .
 \r\n ' , 'hearing the words \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a match with your brother ! \xe2\x80\x9d was surreal .
 \r\n ' , ' i couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it !
 so i asked , \xe2\x80\x9creally , i am ? \xe2\x80\x9d to which she replied , \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a perfect match ! \xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , ' i couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold the tears back .
 i was so overwhelmed with gratitude .
 our prayers had been answered .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' i asked greta if my brother , eric knew yet and was told no because of patient rights .
 \r\n ' , 'they always check with the one donating first and get a verbal commitment \r\n ' , 'that they are going to proceed forward before notifying the bone marrow recipient .
 \r\n ' , ' i assured greta that i was going to be the donor for my brother and with that , \r\n ' , 'she said that i could call my brother and share the good news with him .
 \r\n ' , ' that was one of the sweetest phone calls that i\xe2\x80\x99ve ever made .
 \r\n ' , 'hearing my dear brothers reaction and crying tears of joy together with him was priceless.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'my insta post announcing that i was a `` perfect match !
 `` \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'once i hung up the phone on my brother , the reality hit me .
 wow !
 what have i just signed up for ?
 \r\n ' , 'my mind started swirling and my emotions were all over the board .
 \r\n ' , ' i felt so happy and yet scared to death at the same time.\r\n ' , ' the thought i kept having was , `` i can handle anything and no matter how much it hurts \r\n ' , 'or what kind of pain i have to endure , i have to do this , i mean , my brother\xe2\x80\x99s life depends on me \r\n ' , 'and i have the awesome opportunity to do this incredible thing and give him a chance to beat this cancer . ''
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' it was monday morning and right as i hung up the phone , still trying to digest all this , my doorbell rang .
 \r\n ' , ' it was julie , who was coming over to join me for our weekly morning of quilting and sewing .
 \r\n ' , 'i told her the wonderful news and we hugged and cried together .
 \r\n ' , 'it was perfect timing and i was grateful that julie was the first one that i was able to celebrate with.\r\n ' , ' she wrapped her arms around me and embraced me.\r\n ' , 'she listened to me as i tried to express my mixed emotions about the journey that i was about to embark on .
 \r\n ' , 'she gave me the reassurance and confidence that i so desperately needed and made me feel like \xe2\x80\x9ci can do this ! \xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , ' it was just the first of many tender mercies of the lord that i experienced during this process \r\n ' , 'where i felt the lord placed someone specific in my life to fulfill a particular role that would help me on my journey .
 \r\n ' , 'this was a gentle reminder that he was aware of exactly what i was going through \r\n ' , 'and i felt his love through the actions of so many friends and family members\r\n ' , ' who were instrumental though out the donation procedure.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'when i first signed up and agreed to being a bone marrow donor for my brother , \r\n ' , 'i thought it would entail taking bone marrow from my hip.\r\n ' , `` that 's all i had ever heard about the process and that it was painful .
 \r\n '' , 'my first thoughts were , \xe2\x80\x9cthis is going to hurt but i have survived giving birth to 5 children without any epidural \r\n ' , 'and one very painful emergency c-section so i can handle this ! \xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , ' mark kept asking me if i had talked to greta about what the procedure was going to be like \r\n ' , 'but i was kind of in denial and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know .
 \r\n ' , 'i figured that i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t go to turn back now so what good was it going to do\r\n ' , ' to hear how much pain i was going to have to endure .
 \r\n ' , ' i thought \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x99ll just deal with it when it comes.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , ' fortunately , allie got online and found out that most bone marrow transplants done these days \r\n ' , 'does not involve taking bone marrow from your hip \r\n ' , 'but instead there was a new process where bone marrow stems cells are taken from your blood .
 \r\n ' , 'it sounded so much easier and a much less invasive process .
 \r\n ' , 'i was excited and the next time greta called we chatted about it \r\n ' , 'and she confirmed that this was indeed the procedure that i would do .
 \r\n ' , ' i expressed my delight upon learning this and she responded , \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited , \r\n ' , 'although it is a simpler procedure , it is no walk in the park either ! \xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , ' those words rang true and she was exactly right as i would later find out .
 \r\n ' , 'but still at that time , it gave me great comfort to know what the bone marrow transplant procedure was.\r\n ' , ' i am grateful that allie took the time to do the research and educate me about i what i about to go through.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the next few weeks were busy .
 my days were filled with scheduling appointments , getting blood work done , \r\n ' , 'filling out pages and pages of medical forms , faxing them back to greta , \r\n ' , 'only to find out that she never received them so i had to do it all over again .
 ugh !
 \r\n ' , ' i was busy making travel plans , booking or rebooking flights\r\n ' , ' and trying to get things done at home so that i could be able to leave at a moments notice .
 \r\n ' , 'i had a couple of trips already booked to nyc to move `` the little girls '' out of their summer apartment \r\n ' , 'and then to help allie and justin move into their new apartment in philly .
 \r\n ' , ' i would have cancelled the trips if they needed me to \r\n ' , 'but greta tried to schedule my appointments in salt lake city around them .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'figuring out the timing was more difficult than i thought \r\n ' , 'because a lot revolved around my brother\xe2\x80\x99s chemo and how he reacted to the treatment .
 \r\n ' , 'i tried to do everything that i needed to do so that i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t holding things up and was ready to leave to go.\r\n ' , ' i wanted to make sure that i did everything i could to help enable us to move forward with the bone marrow donation.\r\n ' , ' i knew my brother was in so much pain so i was highly motivated to make sure this happened .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'at times it got frustrating , hurrying up and getting things done on my end\r\n ' , ' and then waiting and waiting to hear back from greta and her team .
 \r\n ' , 'plans were made and then i\xe2\x80\x99d get a call and things had changed .
 \r\n ' , ' such was the case when i packed up and flew to new york at the beginning of august .
 \r\n ' , 'i planned on flying to utah on my way home , thinking that the donation procedure would take place at that time , \r\n ' , ' only to find out that more doctor tests were scheduled on that visit .
 \r\n ' , 'it kind of took me for a loop and i was a little discouraged when they rescheduled the donation transplant \r\n ' , 'and butted it up right against a trip that we had to nyc later in august to attend the us open .
 \r\n ' , ' i learned that i needed to learn to be patient and flexible\r\n ' , ' or else i surely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make it through this process .
 \r\n ' , ' i was not in control of my schedule and i had to let go \r\n ' , 'and just be available whenever and do whatever they needed be to do .
 \r\n ' , ' for someone who is a planner and scheduler , this was a hard thing to give up\r\n ' , ' but i am proud to say that i kind of surprised myself \r\n ' , 'and adapted to \xe2\x80\x9cjust going with the flow\xe2\x80\x9d without too much complaining.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as i mentioned , the bone marrow donation process seemed like \r\n ' , 'it was going to be a lot easier than what i thought i had originally signed up for .
 \r\n ' , 'from what i read about it on the internet it was simply a non-surgical procedure , \r\n ' , 'which involved being given injections of filgrastim , \r\n ' , 'a drug that would stimulate bone marrow stem cells for 5 days leading up to donation .
 \r\n ' , 'harvesting my bone marrow stems cells would take place over a two day time period\r\n ' , ' in which blood is removed through a needle on one arm \r\n ' , 'and passed through a machine that separates out the blood-forming cells .
 \r\n ' , 'the remaining blood is returned to you through the other arm .
 sounds easy enough , right ? !
 \r\n ' , ' i think i underestimated what i was about to take on and was a little over confident and naive.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' i was a little embarrassed by all the love and support that my family and dear friends showered upon me .
 \r\n ' , 'i can\xe2\x80\x99t even begin to list all yummy treats and goodies left on my front door and the lovely cards and notes that i was given.\r\n ' , ' as i left for my first round of doctor appointments in salt lake , this is what my kitchen kitchen island looked like .
 \r\n ' , ' i felt very loved and i was very aware that i had many family and friends that were praying for me .
 \r\n ' , ' i am ever so grateful those prayers .
 i really do have the best friends ! \r\n ' , ' i was also grateful to the beautiful priesthood blessing that mark and brad wilkes gave me which gave me great comfort .
 \r\n ' , ' little did i know that those prayers and that priesthood blessing would carry me through some difficult days ahead.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i spent two full days at the lds hospital in salt lake , filled with doctor appointments , \r\n ' , 'including a full check-up , lots of blood was drawn which was to be tested .
 \r\n ' , ' i was given an ekg , had to fill out more paper work and medical history forms filled \r\n ' , 'and met with more doctors and counselors explaining the whole process and what to expect .
 \r\n ' , ' and at the end of it all , was deemed \xe2\x80\x9ca viable candidate\xe2\x80\x9d to be a donor for my brother .
 yay !
 \r\n ' , 'my patient rights were explained to me and then i signed the important legal forms \r\n ' , 'to commit to be my brother\xe2\x80\x99s bone marrow donor .
 it was official ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'so what did the doctors say that i would experience during this process ?
 \r\n ' , ' as i said , i would be given a injection of the drug filgrastim every morning for 5 days , \r\n ' , ' which increases the production of bone marrow stem cells in my body .
 \r\n ' , ' i was told the drug could make me feel achy and tired , possibly nauseous , perhaps experience bad headaches , \r\n ' , ' i might have the chills or feel pain in my bones , basically any flu-like condition is a possible side effect from the drug .
 \r\n ' , 'i was told that each person reacts differently to the drug but i might experience one , all or none of these side effects .
 \r\n ' , ' i thought , \xe2\x80\x9ci can handle this !
 i mean how bad can it be ?
 so i\xe2\x80\x99ll be sick for a week .
 big deal ! \xe2\x80\x9d \r\n ' , ' and since i never had morning sickness or the stomach flu and rarely get nauseous , \r\n ' , 'i told myself that i was just going to think positive and power through it and not let myself get sick or nauseous .
 \r\n ' , ' the doctors said the side effects from the drug would probably be the worst part of the process .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the retrieval would take place over a two day period following the 5 days of injections .
 \r\n ' , ' each morning i would be hooked up to a machine that would draw my blood , \r\n ' , ' retrieving the stems cells needed for my brother and then return my blood back into my body .
 \r\n ' , 'i was given two choices of how this would take place .
 \r\n ' , '1 ) i could have tubes inserted in the veins of both of my arms , \r\n ' , 'one drawing the blood which would be filtered through a machine to retrieve the bone marrow cells \r\n ' , 'and then the blood would return back in my other arm or \r\n ' , '2 ) i could have a pick placed in my neck which would have multiple lines to retrieve and return the blood .
 \r\n ' , 'this was a tough decision to make because the pick was more invasive \r\n ' , 'but would make it easier to unhook the lines and gave me the freedom to move around , \r\n ' , 'get up and go to the bathroom or just stretch and that seemed like such a good idea \r\n ' , 'since i was told to plan on being at the hospital 6-8 hours each day during this retrieval process .
 \r\n ' , ' the red cross counselor also mentioned that i might feel a little anxious or claustophobic being hooked up to the machine .
 \r\n ' , ' with those things in mind , i chose the pick that would be placed in my neck ! \r\n ' , ' with all the decisions made and information about the procedure given to me , \r\n ' , ' i flew home for a few days before i was scheduled to come back to start the whole process.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'brooke and ashley both volunteered to give up some of their summer vacation to take care of me .
 \r\n ' , ' we had a few fun days in california together and then they drove back to utah earlier than they had planned .
 \r\n ' , ' i can not thank them enough for all that they did for me that week .
 \r\n ' , ' i thought that i would feel well enough and that we could hang out and do some fun things together .
 \r\n ' , `` i did n't know how sick the drug was going to make me\r\n '' , ' and how much i would need the little girls help as they would literally get me up everyday , drag me out of bed , dress me ( i always feel so much better dressed for the day and my hair and make up done.\r\n ' , ' they made sure that i had time to get ready every day ! )
 \r\n ' , ' they had treats and notes from different family members \r\n ' , ' and always a diet pepsi with ribbons tied to it waiting for me in the car every morning .
 \r\n ' , ' they held my hand when i got the injections everyday and rubbed my back when i was nauseous .
 \r\n ' , `` they did n't complain once.\r\n '' , ' they waited on me hand and foot , spending long days at the hospital , making sure that i got \r\n ' , 'wherever i needed to be every day , even if it meant that we left the house at the wee hours of the morning .
 \r\n ' , ' they ran errands for me , picked up anti-nausea prescriptions , \r\n ' , ' grabbed any kind of food item that i craved , \r\n ' , 'hoping to find something that i would eat and possibly keep down .
 \r\n ' , ' they kept me company when i was so sick that all i could do was lie in bed and watch the disney channel .
 \r\n ' , 'yep !
 we watched princess and the pea , cinderella and titanic ... twice !
 \r\n ' , ' they were amazing and i couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it without them .
 \r\n ' , ' they came to help me save my brothers life , little did they know that they would end up saving mine.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i flew in on thursday afternoon .
 brooke picked me up from the airport \r\n ' , 'and we immediately went to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants , the dodo .
 \r\n ' , ' their banana cream cheese pie is the best !
 yum !
 \r\n ' , ' afterwards , we ran over to the park across the street and took the photo below that i instragrammed .
 \r\n ' , 'ashley joined us that night in park city and with the two little girls by my side , \r\n ' , ' there were indeed a lot of laughs and giggles .
 \r\n ' , 'it was the perfect way to end the day.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'early the next morning , we drove down to the lds hospital in downtown salt lake \r\n ' , 'and i was given the first of many injections of filgrastim .
 \r\n ' , 'the next few days are kind of a blur .
 it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the drugs to make me to feel pretty crummy .
 \r\n ' , ' i was one of those \xe2\x80\x9clucky\xe2\x80\x9d patients that experienced all of the negative side effects that i \xe2\x80\x9ccould or might\xe2\x80\x9d experience .
 \r\n ' , 'all of them !
 i was achy , tired , and nauseous ... really nauseous .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ve never been sicker in my whole life !
 \r\n ' , ' i couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep anything down and nothing sounded good .
 not even diet pepsi sounded good .
 \r\n ' , 'my head hurt , my bones and joints ached and since i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to keep anything down , i was so weak .
 \r\n ' , ' brooke was so sweet and documented everything .
 \r\n ' , 'i\xe2\x80\x99ve had people tell me that i looked pretty good considering how bad i felt .
 \r\n ' , ' i think brooke must have photoshopped them .
 actually , i know she did : ) !
 thanks girl ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'this was a picture of me getting my first injection by one of our favorite nurses .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'ashley held my hand every time i got an injection .
 what a sweetie ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'visiting my brother after i got my shots for the day .
 \r\n ' , 'poor thing was so exhausted from all the chemo treatments that he was going through .
 sure do love him ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'my sweet dad came drove up that day to check in on his kids .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'about a week before i started my filgrastim injections , my brother begun an intensive round of chemo \r\n ' , 'which would basically kill off all his bone marrow in order to prepare him to receive mine .
 \r\n ' , 'he was at the lds hospital on the same floor where i received my shots\r\n ' , ' and the bone marrow donation would take place so we would visit after my appointments , \r\n ' , 'check in on him and visit with his wife , marylynn .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' it was really wonderful to be able to spend time with eric and marylynn\r\n ' , 'but also very humbling to watch him go through the pain and suffering that he had to deal with .
 \r\n ' , 'it was a great reminder that whatever i was dealing with paled in comparison to what he had already dealt with \r\n ' , 'and he still had a long road ahead of him with no guarantees .
 \r\n ' , 'i knew that after this was over that i would heal and go back to leading my normal life , \r\n ' , 'he on the other hand was going to be fighting for his life every step of the way.\r\n ' , `` i cherished the visits that we had and his sweet wife 's positive spirit and grateful attitude.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'eric had a little bit more energy that day and even sat up and smiled when we took a picture .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it was sunday and by the time we finished with the injections and checking in on eric , \r\n ' , 'we had missed church so we decided to drive up to bountiful and see the temple .
 \r\n ' , 'we stopped on the way and took this picture and instagrammed about `` b '' ing a match , \r\n ' , 'encouraging people to sign up for the national registry at bethematch.com.\r\n ' , `` so if you have n't already signed up do it ! \r\n '' , 'we walked around the temple grounds and tried to take a few pictures \r\n ' , 'but it was a windy day ... \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'and this is what happens on windy days sometimes.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'these two are the bestest of friends and greatest daughters a mother could ask for.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it was a great sunday afternoon with my little girls\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n ' , 'until i got home and the nauseousness began and i felt awful , \r\n ' , 'but for at that moment i felt great and excited to be able to help my brother\r\n ' , 'and be with my little girls and it felt like a little bit of heaven on earth.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'getting my injections on the 3rd day.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'sweet ashley held my hand while i got my shots every day .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` finally , the day came to start the bone marrow stem cells retrieval process and i could n't be more excited .
 \r\n '' , 'excited to get one to the next stage and get it over with .
 \r\n ' , `` i was so sick from the drugs and weak because i had n't been able to keep anything down at all .
 nothing .
 \r\n '' , 'i was anxious and excited that morning as we arrived at the hospital at 7 am .
 \r\n ' , 'after receiving another injection of filgrastim , i was whisked off to a surgery room to have my pick implanted , \r\n ' , ' which definitely was painful but i think because i had mentally prepared for it , \r\n ' , ' i seemed to handle that part of the process much better than i thought i would .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'here is the one picture of me in my hospital gown so i had to include it.\r\n ' , 'i don\'t know why but i felt much worse when i had that gown on \r\n ' , 'so i asked the nurse if i could change back into my regular clothes and she said that was fine.\r\n ' , 'i never put a hospital gown on the rest of the time .
 ha !
 ha ! \r\n ' , `` it 's a dumb thing and maybe i 'm too vain to wear that ugly thing\r\n '' , 'but as mark always says , `` look sharp !
 feel sharp ! ''
 and i feel like it is really true for me.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'so i\ 'm back in my regular clothes and the little girls are having way too much fun \r\n ' , 'pushing me in the wheelchair around the hospital hallways.\r\n ' , 'i did indeed feel weird having something sticking out of my neck and it was uncomfortable\r\n ' , ' but i had been warned that it would be awkward and i think because i was in so much other pain\r\n ' , ' and so nauseated that it was probably the least of my worries , which was a good thing .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'with my pick in my neck , i was ready to be hooked up to the machine , \r\n ' , ' which would draw my blood , filter out my stems cells , then return the blood into my body .
 \r\n ' , 'this process would continue for about 5-6 hours until they felt like all the bone marrow stems cells \r\n ' , 'that my body had produced for that day had been retrieved .
 \r\n ' , ' with my girls by my side and my warm blanket over me , \r\n ' , 'i got cozy and comfy and tried to relax and let the machine do its thing .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'once i was hooked up to the machine , i was experiencing this weird sensation of vibration \r\n ' , 'and this odd pulsating feeling throughout my body .
 \r\n ' , 'it was as if i could feel the blood circulating everywhere\r\n ' , ' and it caused me to feel exactly like they said i would , claustrophobic.\r\n ' , `` we tried to watch an episode of modern family but i could n't concentrate or focus at all \r\n '' , 'so i finally took some more pain meds and closed my eyes and just tried to sleep .
 \r\n ' , 'my girls were great and held my hand and rubbed my back and tried to help me feel comfortable .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' at one point , my brother walked all the way from his room to visit me and it was so sweet of him.\r\n ' , ' all i had to do was take one look at him and i was reminded that whatever pain or suffering that i was experiencing \r\n ' , 'was nothing compared to what he has gone through so i just needed to get over it .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'minutes later , my dad showed up to be with me during the day and help me pass the time.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' i felt so nauseous and agitated at that moment and he held my hand and comforted me , \r\n ' , 'the way that only a loving parent can and i felt as if my mom was there with us , watching over me .
 \r\n ' , ' those were sweet moments that i am so grateful for , to feel the love and support from my family meant so much to me.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'both eric and i felt truly blessed to be surrounded by loving family members .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' the rest of the day passed by with only one episode of feeling so nauseous and claustrophobic \r\n ' , 'that i had to have the nurse detach all the pick lines and i ran to the bathroom.\r\n ' , `` sorry , tmi !
 i 'll keep the rest of the details to myself .
 \r\n '' , 'but i was so glad that i had chosen to do the pick and had the option to get up out of bed when i needed to.\r\n ' , `` i do n't know how to explain exactly how you feel except maybe anxious , claustrophobic and high strung .
 \r\n '' , ' but after throwing some water on my face and taking a few deep breathes , \r\n ' , 'i was able to go back and get reattached and finish up that afternoon .
 \r\n ' , ' it really made a difference being able to take a break and regroup .
 \r\n ' , ' by the time my nurse said that they were finished retrieving my bone marrow stems cells for the day \r\n ' , 'and i could go home , i was so ready to leave the hospital and so were the little girls .
 \r\n ' , 'as soon as we got back to park city , i took more anti-nausea and pain medicine and climbed into bed .
 \r\n ' , 'we were so happy that day 1 of retrieval was done !
 \r\n ' , 'just one more day and i would be finished or so i thought ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` getting my last day of filgrastim injections !
 yay !
 i 'm so happy ! \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'with ashley sitting by my side , holding my hand and taking care of me , \r\n ' , `` i 'm ready for what should have been a pretty uneventful last day of retrieval .
 \r\n '' , ' the little girls made sure that i had everything that i needed to make it through the day .
 \r\n ' , `` i do n't know who was more excited to get it all over with , the little girls or me !
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` we had n't been there too long when , greta came in to check on me\r\n '' , ' and informed me that they had retrieved 1 million bone marrow stems from me the first day .
 \r\n ' , 'i was like , `` wow !
 that is awesome !
 how many do you need to collect ? ''
 \r\n ' , ' i was confused because i was thinking that a million is a dang lot and i was doing great , \r\n ' , ' but the look on her face was of great concern .
 she obviously did not seem to share my enthusiasm .
 \r\n ' , 'she turned to me and with great disappointment in her voice said , \r\n ' , ' '' well , ideally we would like to gather 5 million for your brother .
 `` \r\n ' , ' what ? ! !
 i quickly did the math and could see that i was in trouble !
 \r\n ' , ' i was told beforehand that it would only take two days to retrieve the stems cells .
 \r\n ' , 'they assured me that only 2 % ever have to do 3 days of retrieval !
 at this rate it may take me 4 days !
 \r\n ' , ' i burst into tears !
 i was so discouraged and sad , \r\n ' , 'partly because i was so tired and sick but mostly because i felt so responsible , \r\n ' , `` like i did n't do my part or like it was somehow my fault that my body\r\n '' , `` did n't produce enough stem cells fast enough for retrieval .
 \r\n '' , `` greta was n't too encouraging but she did hand me some kleenexes and said , \r\n '' , ' `` well , don\'t worry , we will see how today goes .
 \r\n ' , 'but yeah , you might was to change your flight for tomorrow . ''
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as soon as she left the room , the little girls snuggled up on either side of my bed , consoling me .
 \r\n ' , 'we were all exhausted and disappointed , and within minutes we all feel asleep for a few hours .
 \r\n ' , 'when we woke up , i immediately got on the phone to delta\r\n ' , ' to change my flight to the latest flight i could get out of salt lake .
 \r\n ' , 'i was hoping that i could come in earlier than usual the third day \r\n ' , 'and hopeful they could collect the final amount without a hitch .
 \r\n ' , 'mark was flying in the next morning to meet up with me , \r\n ' , 'so i switched both of our flights out of slc to the very last flight in the evening .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as i sat on hold with delta , trying to rearrange my flight , i felt more and more nauseous\r\n ' , ' and i noticed that my body was starting to cramp up again like it did the day before .
 \r\n ' , `` this time it was ten times worse and no matter what i did , i could n't shake off the cramps.\r\n '' , ' it was like my whole body was having a `` charlie horse '' cramp and i had no control over what my body was doing .
 \r\n ' , ' i was in so much pain and discomfort so i told the american red cross technician who was monitoring the machine .
 \r\n ' , `` he acknowledged that i did n't look good and was low in magnesium but hr was busy collecting the blood .
 \r\n '' , 'when my nurse finally came in , i told her what was going on , \r\n ' , `` and she acknowledged that my magnesium was low too but did n't offer any solution .
 \r\n '' , ' the pulsating feelings in my body were out of control \r\n ' , `` and my hands begin to feel as if they were paralyzed and i could n't move them .
 \r\n '' , ' i couldn\'t concentrate and it got so bad that i had to give ashley the phone to finish rebooking my flight with delta .
 \r\n ' , `` i just laid there in pain .
 it was about as sick as i 've ever been .
 \r\n '' , 'the technician could tell that it was really bad so he asked if i wanted to finish for the day .
 \r\n ' , 'part of me really wanted to but i was so concerned about the stem cell count being so low that i said that i would go on .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as the hours wore on it got worse and worse .
 i knew something was wrong\r\n ' , `` but the technician and my nurse did n't seem too concerned .
 \r\n '' , ' the day before when i was low in calcium and they gave me a calcium drip , and that really helped.\r\n ' , `` i 'm not really sure why my nurse or the technician did n't do anything about the low magnesium that day\r\n '' , `` but they did n't , so i just laid there and endured the pain .
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` around 1 pm i was in so much pain that i had had enough , i just could n't take it anymore.\r\n '' , ' so when the technician again asked if i wanted to be done for the day and go home , \r\n ' , ' i was just about ready to take him up on his offer .
 \r\n ' , 'right then susan duke , one of my oldest and dearest friends , called \r\n ' , 'and said that she was coming over to visit in a few minutes .
 \r\n ' , `` i decided to wait because i did n't want to miss susan , who arrived about 20 minutes later .
 \r\n '' , `` i tried to pull myself together so that susan would n't suspect anything .
 \r\n '' , `` i did n't want her to know how sick i was and cause her any concern \r\n '' , 'but as the minutes went on , it became harder and harder .
 \r\n ' , 'she was adorable and brought me a huge basket of all of my favorite treats , which was so sweet of her !
 \r\n ' , 'she was cheerful and sweet with the girls but as time went on , \r\n ' , `` i finally i could n't take it any long and told the technician that i was done .
 \r\n '' , 'i sent ashley down to get the car and told brooke to pack me up for the day .
 \r\n ' , `` all the sudden i got so incredibly nauseous that i did n't even have time to ask them to unhook me from the machine .
 \r\n '' , ' the nurse could see it coming and gave me a bag , just in time for me to throw up into it , not once but three times .
 \r\n ' , ' i felt out of control and just like that , it through my whole body into a tailspin.\r\n ' , ' i sat back and the next few minutes are kind of a blur .
 \r\n ' , 'my hands were completely frozen in a strange claw-like position \r\n ' , 'along with the rest of my body completely cramping up , and i felt like i was having a seizure or a stroke .
 \r\n ' , 'i just wanted to get unhooked from the machine and felt that would make me feel better and fix everything .
 \r\n ' , ' i tried to stay calm as brooke was packing me up and the tech unhooked the lines.\r\n ' , ' i asked susan if she could put my shoes on because i couldn\'t move my hands .
 \r\n ' , 'she came around to the other side of the bed and knelt down to grab my shoes , \r\n ' , 'but she took one look at my feet which were also in an awkward muscle spasm state and looked up at me \r\n ' , 'and with a frightened look on her face said , `` i don\'t think you should go home.\r\n ' , ' something is very wrong and i think you better get back in that bed . ''
 \r\n ' , 'i knew she was right .
 and she picked me up and put me back into bed .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i laid there looking up at brooke , who had a look of fear on her face\r\n ' , `` and i wanted to cry , but did n't want to scare her.\r\n '' , ' i knew that i was in bad shape , really bad .
 i had no control over my body .
 \r\n ' , ' i felt like i was having a stroke and my words were slurred when i spoke.\r\n ' , ' i thought , `` why is this happening to me ?
 \r\n ' , 'how could something bad happen to me when i was trying to do something good ? ''
 \r\n ' , ' and then i thought `` bad things happen to good people . ''
 \r\n ' , 'i knew that there were risks , even though they are extremely rare , \r\n ' , 'i had been warned that one of the things that could potentially go wrong would be a stroke or heart attack .
 \r\n ' , 'so i braced myself and at that moment , i turned everything over to the lord .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i laid there helplessly , looking at brooke for comfort , trying to be strong for her , \r\n ' , ' and i put my trust in the lord that `` all would be well . ''
 \r\n ' , ' i thought of the beautiful priesthood blessing that mark and brad wilkes had given me \r\n ' , 'before i left home and that gave me great comfort .
 \r\n ' , `` i honestly did n't know what was happening to me or how it was all going to turn out but i felt at peace .
 \r\n '' , 'i watched as brooke was frantically texting allie and checking the monitor on the machine .
 \r\n ' , 'as soon as allie got the information about my levels , she told brooke to run and get my doctor , now ! \r\n ' , 'thank goodness , i have daughters who are on top of things ! \r\n ' , 'while brooke was gone , getting help , susan stayed and comforted me , \r\n ' , ' and within minutes , my nurse appeared , along with a nurse practitioner , \r\n ' , ' a guy with an ekg machine and others who began working on me , trying to figure out what was going on .
 \r\n ' , 'fortunately , i still had my pick in , so they were able to quickly draw vials of blood\r\n ' , ' and an ekg was done , they were trying to assess if it was a heart attack.\r\n ' , `` i did n't think so , i really thought i was having a stroke .
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` i could n't even communicate at that moment and by the look on brooke 's face , \r\n '' , ' i knew that she was terrified for me and i was so scared that something was going to happen to me too.\r\n ' , ' how grateful i was that susan was there to comfort brooke .
 \r\n ' , ' i kept thinking that if something did happen , which would be horrible for brooke to witness , \r\n ' , `` but at least susan would be there to comfort her and i could n't think of anyone that would do a better job then susan .
 \r\n '' , ' at that moment , it gave me great peace of mind , knowing that and it helped me stay calm .
 \r\n ' , `` this was another tender mercy .
 i knew it was n't just a coincidence that she came to visit right at that time.\r\n '' , `` i knew that she could help me through this crisis and if it were n't for her visit , \r\n '' , `` i would have left the hospital and would n't have been able to get the immediate help that i needed.\r\n '' , `` i 'm so very grateful to susan , for being there for me when i needed her the most.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'minutes later , my doctor ran in .
 brooke had tracked her down in the hospital\r\n ' , ' and told her what was going on and she came running .
 \r\n ' , ' she explained that my magnesium level had plummented , something that she said she has never seen before .
 \r\n ' , ' this was the cause of my muscle cramps/spasms that i was experiencing \r\n ' , 'but the main concern was that it could cause a heart attack , thus the reason for the ekg .
 \r\n ' , 'she informed me that they were starting me on a magnesium drip , which would take 4 hours .
 \r\n ' , 'she left for about 15-20 minutes while they set up the drip \r\n ' , `` and returned to inform me that she had met with eric 's team of doctors\r\n '' , ' and they had determined that i was not to continue the process any longer , \r\n ' , ' even though i was scheduled for a third day of retrieval .
 \r\n ' , ' i told her that i was ok now and that i rebooked my flight and i was fine about staying another day .
 \r\n ' , ' i begged her to let me complete the donation .
 \r\n ' , 'i knew that the number of stem cells that they had retrieved was low \r\n ' , `` and i was worried that they did n't have enough for my brother 's transplant.\r\n '' , 'i felt like i had come this far and i just wanted to finish the job .
 \r\n ' , ' she said that they had retrieved a much higher amount of stem cells the second day\r\n ' , 'and she tried to convince me that they thought they had just enough for the transplant to be successful .
 \r\n ' , `` i still pleaded with her and promised that i would n't let this happen again \r\n '' , ' ( like i had much control over my low magnesium level . )
 \r\n ' , 'she wouldn\'t budge and finally said , `` debbie , we aren\'t going to risk losing you in order to save your brother . ''
 \r\n ' , 'oh !
 ok !
 i guess what just happened to me was pretty serious ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'about this time , we remembered that ashley was waiting downstairs in the car , \r\n ' , ' so we told her to go park the car and come back up .
 susan was such a doll for staying as long as she did \r\n ' , 'but now that i felt like i was out of the woods , i insisted that she get back to her family .
 \r\n ' , `` again , i could n't thank her enough for being there for me , like she has so many times in my life.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'we were all pretty bummed about having to stay at the hospital for 4 more hours .
 \r\n ' , 'they started my magnesium drip and although i was excited to get that going \r\n ' , 'because i knew that it would help with my muscle spasms\r\n ' , ' and relieve my body of the paralyzed state that it was in , i knew that it was going to be miserable .
 \r\n ' , 'my dear friend , julie , has to get a magnesium drip after giving birth to each of her children.\r\n ' , ' i remember her telling me how miserable it is .
 and she was right .
 \r\n ' , 'while the muscle cramps and spasms ended , i experienced a burning/scratching feeling as the drip entered my body .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'about 15 minutes after the drip started , in walked our dear friends , scott and linda howell .
 \r\n ' , `` i ca n't tell you how happy we were to see them .
 my girls were exhausted , emotionally and physically \r\n '' , `` and just needed an extra hug , which i could n't really provide right then .
 \r\n '' , 'ash and brooke had been the best little caretakers all week \r\n ' , 'and then watching me go through such trauma was just about all they could endure .
 \r\n ' , `` the howell 's come right when they did was another sweet tender mercy .
 \r\n '' , 'they had no idea what had just happened so when they saw me , linda almost started crying .
 \r\n ' , 'the girls just fell into their arms and we all shed a few tears .
 mine were happy tears .
 \r\n ' , 'to have such wonderful people in my life , showed up exactly when i needed them to was truly another tender mercy .
 \r\n ' , 'such a blessing that i will ever be grateful to them for comforting the little girls when they needed a little love.\r\n ' , ' the next 4 hours flew by as we chatted and visited with scott and linda .
 \r\n ' , 'they are the best friends and my girls adore them\r\n ' , ' so it was such a fun treat and perfect way to end such a emotional and stressful day ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` while we were hanging out with the howell 's , my brother , eric , was receiving my stem cells , which contained my bone marrow .
 \r\n '' , ' they call that moment , a `` new birthday '' for my brother , because it is a new chance on life .
 \r\n ' , ' i thought it would be fun to celebrate and be with him when they give him the blood transfusion and take a few pictures .
 \r\n ' , 'i really wanted to share that moment with him but then it was just a little chaotic that afternoon \r\n ' , `` and at some point i just told brooke to run the party stuff up to eric 's room and wish him well.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'once the drip was done , my nurse came in to remove my pick .
 \r\n ' , 'i had to include this photo of what the pick looked like .
 i\ 'm sorry , i know it\ 's gross.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i thought she would give me some anesthesia or something but she just clipped the stitches and pulled this tube out of my neck .
 \r\n ' , 'it was the strangest thing to feel it coming out of your body .
 as you can see , i was trying to be brave ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the tube that would draw the blood out of my body .
 thanks brooke , for getting this shot of it and documenting everything for me.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'yay !
 all done !
 i had a large whole in my neck but just had to hold this gauze pad and apply pressure and i was good to go.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the next day i arrived at the hospital early to run through the last few tests \r\n ' , 'to decide if i was healthy enough to get cleared to travel that day .
 \r\n ' , 'i was thrilled that every test came back with good results and i was able to leave the hospital .
 \r\n ' , `` after stopping by eric 's room and visiting with him and his wife , marylynn , i walked out of the hospital for the last time.\r\n '' , 'they were in good spirits and very sweet and appreciative of my stem cell donation.\r\n ' , 'now we just had to wait and see if his body was going to accept the donation.\r\n ' , 'this was the hard part to leave not knowing if the transplant was going to work or not.\r\n ' , 'leaving my brother that day was hard and all i could do was hope and pray that it would be a success .
 \r\n ' , 'we walked out of the hospital and had to take a picture .
 \r\n ' , ' i wanted to do a jumping one but after one futile attempt to jump , \r\n ' , ' i neither had the energy nor balance , so brooke and i decided this pose was good enough ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'brooke took this picture of one of the beautiful flowers outside the hospital.\r\n ' , `` i love it because it represents the god 's beauty and his love that we felt\r\n '' , `` at the conclusion of what was one of the most incredible and difficult things that i 've ever done in my life .
 \r\n '' , ' i know that he lives .
 and that he loves me and my brother and everyone of us .
 \r\n ' , 'but most of all , that he is aware of all that we are going through and will never leave us .
 \r\n ' , `` he is always with us .
 and i 'm ever so grateful for this blessing in my life.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'now , one might ask , would you do it all over again ?
 \r\n ' , ' right at that moment , i probably would have hesitated but said `` yes .
 `` \r\n ' , `` as hard as it was , i ca n't even explain how incredible it feels to know that i helped save a life.\r\n '' , 'no words can describe that feeling and i am humbled and feel very honored\r\n ' , ' to have had the opportunity to give someone a second chance on life.\r\n ' , 'now that time has passed and i have completely healed , i would answer , enthusiastically , `` yes ! ''
 \r\n ' , 'my brother , eric , celebrated the 100 day milestone last month.\r\n ' , 'his body has accepted my stem cells and my bone marrow has replaced his.\r\n ' , 'he has not shown any indication of graft versus host disease , \r\n ' , 'which means he has had no rejection of the stem cell transplant.\r\n ' , 'he is tapering off the anti-rejection meds and if all goes well , within 9 months he will be done with them.\r\n ' , 'tests show that 96 % of his bone marrow is now being produced by my stem cells.\r\n ' , `` and another amazing part is that his blood type , a- will change to mine , o+ !
 is n't that crazy ? !
 \r\n '' , 'modern medicine is just amazing and i am so grateful for it , \r\n ' , 'and so very grateful for the miracles in my life , but most of all , right now , \r\n ' , `` i am grateful to have played a small role in this miracle in my brother 's life . '' ]

 it is hard to remember what life consisted of before the nightly feedings and constant diaper duties .
 its like i have been brainwashed to forget all those days of luxury naps and carrying a purse instead of a diaper bag .
 i love being a mother though ( even more when she\ 's napping in my arms ! )
 and i wouldn\'t change it for the world .
 heres what our days consist of since becoming dad and mom.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'sleeping- and not enough .
 i really took the advice `` sleep when they are sleeping '' seriously .
 it has been my favorite activity .
 i just don\'t want her to nap alone !
 ; ) \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` nursing and burping- no one tells you that your new occupation is going to feel like you 're the local watering hole .
 the time in between feedings goes by so fast !
 i sometimes feel like she is glued to my boob for a good portion of the day .
 peyton is a great burping buddy and takes over that duty with total dedication .
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` outings- we went to church for the first time and everyone was very excited to see the newest member of the congregation .
 we were told that we came back to church too early , but peyton and i needed to get some social interaction with people who we did n't talk baby to all day .
 ( yes , thats a language . )
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' pictures - and so many !
 as a new parent i am convinced you believe everything your little one does is the cutest thing that has ever been done .
 for instance , i took a picture of her really big poop blowout the other day .
 i really felt like a mom at that moment .
 i try and send peyton a picture of samantha everyday so he feels more included in our happenings while at work .
 this was the first day he went back to work .
 samantha told me what to write .
 she is extremely bright .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'crying- ohh ... the crying .
 i would like to mention here that before having a child i had no idea how loud something so small could get .
 luckily , homegirl likes her pacifier .
 unluckily , she hasn\'t quite figured out how to keep it in the whole time and cries ( okay , screams ) when this happens .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'errands - since we don\'t have a car in china , i am hitting the pavement with my gal strapped to my chest .
 this is fine except , the chinese are extremely curious and look down into the carrier to get a glimpse of what i am toting around .
 you\ 'd think they would be disappointed with just seeing a small head , but no , this makes their day .
 i am happy to provide that .
 at least they aren\'t rubbing my pregnant belly anymore .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' baths - after that gross , dried up , stinky bellybutton stump fell off we could give her a full bath .
 she loves it !
 its funny to see her experience all these simple things .
 her facial expressions are amazing .
 she must get that from her dad .
 they also really calm her down and help her sleep so ... we bathe her every night .
 side note : it looks like she is trying to escape , but this was just a bad timed picture .
 her leg was carefully put back into the tub immediately .
 ( that note was mainly for grandma ) .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` walks- samantha really enjoys being moved around .
 she takes her best naps while on the move .
 i do n't get it .
 almost the minute she is in complete stillness she wakes up .
 its comical because the sidewalks in shanghai are the bumpiest pavement i have ever walked on .
 she does not seem to be fazed by this one bit.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` swaddling- i want to hug whoever came up with wrapping your kid up like a burrito .
 samantha loves being confined and wrapped up .
 peyton is the swaddle king .
 i still have n't mastered it .
 probably because i always have peyton do it .
 why mess with perfection ?
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` so there you have it .
 the first 3 weeks of having a newborn .
 is n't it fascinating ?
 eating , crying and pooping .
 its a party up in here these days !
 but in all seriousness , we love being parents and we are smiling a lot more these days because of this little lady .
 we just ca n't get enough of her sweetness .

 [ 'date : 5/28/2015\r\n ' , 'site : http : //shullfamily.blogspot.com/2014/08/colorado-road-trip.html\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'tuesday , august 19 , 2014\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'colorado road trip\r\n ' , 'the shull family just came back from a road trip .
 i could have named this post the longest post shay has ever written , but i didn\'t .
 nevertheless , i apologize for the length ... i wanted to fit the entire trip into this one post : ) .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we decided it was time to load the kids up and head out for beautiful colorado .
 we made a full circle ... leaving dallas and heading to amarillo for the night , then cutting through new mexico until we arrived in breckenridge , colorado .
 when we came home , we went through denver and then down through kansas and oklahoma until we were back to dallas .
 both legs of the trip took about 15 hours .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it was your typical road trip ... there was scenery , lots of yummy food , a little puking , some site seeing , car sickness and a fender bender .
 you know , we did it griswold style .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as a side note ( this will come into play at the end of the trip ) , back on may 5 , the kids and i were in a car accident that totaled my car .
 since my car was only a year old , i wanted to replace it with the exact same car ... but there is a huge waiting list for this car now , so i was told by every dealership that would take 4 months to replace my car ... and i chose to wait it out .
 the first two months of the summer , i drove andrew\ 's wrapped car that has his face all over it ( lucky me ) and then the last two months , the dealership was able to provide me with a loaner car .
 we drove the loaner car on this trip .
 keep this in mind ; ) .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'monday afternoon , we headed out to amarillo to spend the night .
 it\ 's about a 6 hour drive from dallas to amarillo , tx.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'my kids are so good in the car .
 i did a post here about traveling in the car with kids ... but i really think it just takes a lot of practice .
 smith did this most of the way ... watch movies .
 ( several of you have asked me where we found the ipad holders and they\ 're from the apple store .
 ) \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'and kensington did this ... play with her toys : ) .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we were so bored and desperate on the way to amarillo that we stopped for dairy queen .
 andrew and i remembered that the last time we had a blizzard was almost 9 years ago on the day we closed on our first house .
 very random shull fact : ) .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the next morning , i put on my car traveling uniform of leggings and my blardigan ... sheaffer and andrea were so jealous of the cold weather and comfy clothes : ) .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'breakfast at cracker barrel ( a road trip requirement , no ? ) .

 so i took 5 minutes to make it presentable.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i didn\'t want to go with traditional fall colors , pumpkins , or leaves .
 i did the traditional fall decor last year , so i thought a change was needed .
 this year i went with a neutral color palette with touches of warm , rustic colors .

 usually i really play it up with lots of colors and elements , but i really like the changes .
 on the left side , i staked some books and topped them with a twine-wrapped candle holder and a small brass owl .

 this chalkboard is an upcycled thrift store frame that i use and reuse for every season.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the right side of the mantel has a tall lantern with another twine-wrapped candle holder .

 it is part of the reason why i do n't sleep well at night , i ca n't turn the brain off .
 and one idea/dream has really stuck with me - having a funky boutique with lots of charm called lavish .
 i finally feel like i am being led along this path and that my dream could actually become a reality .
 i do n't know what will come of it , but if i do n't start walking towards it , i will never make it.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'it started out with this blog , my first public appearance and showing of diy projects and decor .
 it was scary , still is sometimes , to put my house and life out for public viewing and comments .
 but i have loved every second of it and each comment makes me smile , even if some aren\'t the nicest .
 it seems like everyone loves my thrifty repurposing and furniture rehabs .
 truth is , most of the furniture rehabs aren\'t for my house ... they are just because i love to fix something up .
 they sit in my garage , at my parents\ ' house , or in the storage unit collecting dust.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'so i have just been living life and blogging a little when a friend told me that i should sign up for a booth at ecofest , which i did .
 moment of madness ?
 anyways , i worked and worked ( and recruited my parents to work and work ) to get ready .
 i had no clue who would come , what would happen , or if i would even have anyone enter my booth .
 there was no turning back though - i paid my booth fee and was testing the waters a little deeper with an actual booth , not just pictures online.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'and you know what ?
 the booth was a hit !
 everyone loved the items , said the booth was the `` must see '' , and continually asked where my store front was .
 did you catch that ... .where is my store !
 i was over the moon because actually hearing the words from complete strangers gave me a huge leap towards my dream , not just a step .
 that huge leap is confidence .
 now i know that i can do this.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'to continue along the path , i now have a website for lavish .
 a bonafide , grown-up , .com website - www.lavishyou.com .
 the site has information about furniture rehabs and e-decorating , but still needs a lot of work .
 ( it is brand new , cut me a little slack . )
 the plan is to modify the site to fit my *hopefully* ever-growing business and one-day store front .
 i would be so happy if you would hop on over to lavish and take a look around .
 please let me know what you think ... be it good or bad.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'what does the future hold ?
 i have no idea .
 but i do know that there will be some major life changing decisions and moments in the year to come .
 i am going to continue walking down the dream path , side-by-side with my family , and see where it takes us.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'posted by bethany 9 comments ' ]

 i hate that show\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i started couponing while pregnant with my oldest son .
 i wanted to get rid of my husband\ 's credit debt and save a little .
 when we decided i should stay home after tristian started having medical problems couponing helped us live within our means .
 realistic , ethical couponing makes that easier .
 i\ 've met many couponers that are awesome people down to earth , smart , practical , moral , realistic , generous .
 i hate the image that the show extreme couponing gives couponers.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'do i stock pile ?
 yes , a little bit ... realistically ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we just bought 31 alba , vitabath , deep steep products ( green , organic , natural , etc ) for $ 1 each ( that\ 's going to be tomorrow\ 's post ) .
 they will be for personal use and gift baskets.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'when we found tomato paste cans for 15\xc2\xa2 a can when a grocery store was clearing out a buy we bought 50 of them for $ 7.50 ... but guess what , we used all 50 well before the expiration dates .
 tomato paste makes speghetti sauce , pizza sauce , chili soup base , anything that requires a tomato base of some sort you can make from tomato paste .
 so yeah , we stock piled them .
 those cans were dated out more then a year for expiration , so we just had to use one a week to use them all by the time they expired .
 not an issue at all and we saved a bundle not buying pizza sauce , spehgetti sauce , tomato juice , etc ... for recipes.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'when we got a bunch of manufacturer toothpaste coupons for 75\xc2\xa2 off toothpaste in the packaging with our electric toothbrushes ( it was a fold out of ten coupons in each package , it was an awesome \'thank you for buying our toothbrush\ ' ) and then found a store sale of the same toothpaste 2 for $ 1.50 , i bought 20 .
 i did some figuring to see what we could use before they expired and sent the rest off as part of a care package to a shelter i\ 'd heard through word of mouth was really struggling to be able to afford personal care items for those it helped .
 i\ 'm still not sure my father\ 's forgiven me and mom for clearing him out of those travel shampoos and soaps he stockpiles when we made that care box up ... ; - ) \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'when we found eco friendly name brands detergent clearanced for $ 1- $ 3 a piece for ones that are normally $ 10+ each you better believe i bought a ton them .
 when i found tide detergent for $ 5 a bottle ( half price ) i bought ten , used ten $ 1 off tide coupons i had from magazine , newspaper and even baby product inserts and sent the receipt in with a rebate for $ 10 back when you spent $ 50 on proctor and gamble products .
 i ended up spending $ 3 each on tide detergent.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'do i buy subscriptions just for the coupons ?
 yes , yes i do .
 so what ?
 everyone is happy .
 the magazines get money for their subscriptions .
 the manufacturers get someone who wants to see their ads , and if a product we try is really good- my husband and i are both the types that we tell people about it- so manufacturers are happy again for more word of mouth .
 the stores get something that is just as good as legal tender to them and i get a deal.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` have i traded , sold or bought coupons ?
 absolutely .
 there are legal ways to do this .
 if a coupon does n't say non transferrable or not valid if sold , transfered etc ... then it 's not an issue .
 i have n't couponed much after having my youngest and am just thinking about starting again .
 i imagine that there 's been a bit of a backlash form extreme couponing and i bet more say this now .
 as of now i have n't even looked into finding trading circles .
 as for buying them from ebay , it can be cost effective if it 's an item you know you will buy and you figure in the cost of buying the coupons towards the amount saved .
 i generally tried to make sure that i sold enough to cover what i spent buying others .
 which basically made it just another form of trading .
 however , i currently do n't even have a paypal account .
 after the third time they locked the account up because someone somewhere tried to hack into it a couple years ago i never reinstated it , did n't feel safe anymore.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` now as much as i dislike extreme couponing , i care even less for store managers or cashiers that give couponers a hard time .
 i 've worked for a grocery store in just about any position you can imagine and several you probably have never considered .
 so i know what i 'm talking about on this .
 it is just bad business practice to hassel a couponer that is using coupons in a valid way .
 and 'too many coupons ' or 'being a habitual coupon user ' is not an invalid way unless the coupons actually state a specific limit the couponer is ignoring .
 i remember a story this summer about a couponer being refused by a kroger store manager because she was a 'habitual coupon user ' , just ridiculous.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` manufacturer coupons are like legal tender to the store .
 giving the cashier a coupon for $ 1.00 off is just like giving the cashier a one dollar bill .
 stacking them with store coupons is no different to the store then using the store coupon alone- and stores want them to use that coupon because it gets them in to the store to spend money .
 why should the store care if the money is the manufacture 's through coupons or the shopper 's from their pocket or a mix of both ?
 my experience is the managers that have issues with coupons do n't understand the premiss of how the coupons work for the store .
 hopefully kroger corporate took care of that situation .
 they at least should understand how bad it is for the bottom line of a store to refuse money . '' ]

 [ 'date : 6/9/2015\r\n ' , 'site : http : //gapyeargirlgoestoeurope.blogspot.com/\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'le d\xc3\xa9part\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'did we have trepidations about leaving our children , jettisoning everything and moving to europe for a year without a home , car or jobs ?
 without a doubt .
 were we fearful about living out of a couple of suitcases , being blissfully unaware of some of the difficulties we would encounter and making up our itinerary as we went along ?
 absolutely .
 it was perhaps the most terrifying thing we\xe2\x80\x99d ever done , but we knew it felt right and that if we\xe2\x80\x99d given in to fears , backed down and decided not to go , we would have regretted it for the rest of our lives.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'there was no grand strategy for our year , no fleshed out , burnished in gold blueprint .
 we had decided to let the year unfold organically on its own without too much definition .
 we wanted enough flexibility to be able to take advantage of possibilities and to change our plans according to how we were feeling .
 there was a skeletal framework , a tentative list of countries , a few ground rules and the fact that we knew where we would start and where we would end : paris.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we kept in mind as the weeks ticked by lawrence durrell\xe2\x80\x99s quote that i included early on in this writing : \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'journeys , like artists , are born and not made .
 a thousand differing circumstances contribute to them , few of them willed or determined by the will -- whatever we may think .
 they flower spontaneously out of the demands of our natures \xe2\x80\x93 and the best of them lead us not only outwards in space , but inwards as well .
 travel can be one of the most rewarding forms of introspection ... \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'and thus we left plenty of room for the spontaneity , flights of fancy and reflection our spirits would require.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'life on the road was not always glamorous .
 traveling does indeed have its difficulties ; there were days of skinned knees , both literal and figurative , on the cobbled streets of europe .
 but was our journey the answer to our long-standing dream of living in europe and absorbing it deep in our souls ?
 the answer is yes , it was all we had dreamed and more.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\xe2\x80\x9cdrama is life with the boring bits left out . ''
 such was alfred hitchcock\xe2\x80\x99s observation and the same might be said of the glorification of long-term travel .
 viewed from the sidelines , it appears to be kaleidoscopic , sophisticated and always in technicolor , every minute of every day .
 but the reality is that much of an extended journey is just life , after all , filled with daily habits and the ordinary tasks of living .
 there are ups and downs , excitement and ennui and yes indeed , there are those tedious boring bits.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the unveiling of the aftermath of our gap year , of our reassimilation into what would be the rest of our life , was about to begin .
 the day of our departure from the escapades of the old world for the possibilities of the new had arrived .
 we had done what we could to make our time in europe last as long as possible \xe2\x80\x93 at least in terms of appreciating every minute and creating vivid memories , but the inexorable flow of time is impossible to stanch .
 it seemed like forever and yet only yesterday that we had landed in france 12 months earlier.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'for the final time in what had become my travel day ritual , i slipped on my uniform of comfort ( my boyfriend jeans , black tee and hiking sandals ) and we whispered goodbye to our paris studio and took to the road .
 bags dragging behind us , we walked past parisians performing the early morning rituals of brasserie sweeping and bistro set up , shop window polishing , plat du jour posting and unstacking and hosing down the plastic-webbed chairs of sidewalk cafes .
 we walked by our favorite little neighborhood boulangerie and despite the urge to pause , resisted the buttery , yeasty smell of fresh croissants and baguettes wafting into the street .
 breakfast at the airport was going to have to do.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as we rolled up the final escalator to the motte-picquet metro platform , serenaded by a busker on an accordion down below , it hit me like an arrow from a tightly strung bow : we were leaving paris , saying goodbye to france and our adventure had come to a close .
 it was a fitting morning elegy for the end of our gap year , filled with lament as i overflowed with emotion .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we\xe2\x80\x99d cross-examined ourselves daily over the previous 12 months about whether taking a gap year was testament to our madness , a tribute to our pluck or just a step in our lives that seemed so right for the time ?
 the answer is likely an amalgam of all three .
 but whatever the answer , what we could attest to was feeling lucky .
 lucky to have had our dream come true .
 lucky to have been able to take a year off from regular life .
 and fortunate to have had calm waters at home such that we were able to take a sabbatical without interruption .
 we ran almost maniacally from the logic characteristic of some self-satisfied individuals of privilege that because they\xe2\x80\x99ve been blessed , they believe they deserve it .
 we simply felt lucky , fortunate and happy that our madness and our pluck had brought us there.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i recalled the newly married filipino couple we\xe2\x80\x99d met in turkey who innocently sought our advice .
 \xe2\x80\x9cis two weeks , \xe2\x80\x9d they asked , \xe2\x80\x9cenough time to see europe ? \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coh my , we replied , \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for a year and we still won\xe2\x80\x99t see it all .
 we\xe2\x80\x99ll barely have scratched the surface.\xe2\x80\x9d after 353 days , 21 countries , 11 capital cities and countless trains , planes , busses , shuttles , rental cars , cable cars , gondolas , ships and ferries , there was still so much more to see.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as our plane lifted off from orly and soared upward , the individual sights of paris and its suburbs quickly blended into the mosaic of rural france below .
 it was a gentle palette of perfectly outlined shapes of color \xe2\x80\x93 the soft greens , tans and browns of the countryside .
 and as sometimes miraculously happens when flying to the us on a clear day from europe , the shoreline of coastal france and then the outline of spain and portugal appeared far below as we headed out over the atlantic .
 we were finally heading home.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'will there be another gap year of travel in our future ?

 my id\xc3\xa9e fixe of a gap year in europe with joe sustained me through many a professional trial , boring weekend , humid washington summer and fleeting vacation.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'but now i find myself asking , what will get me through those hurdles now that the vision has been realized ?

 will life be hard on us , now members of the \xe2\x80\x9cthose whose dreams have actually come true\xe2\x80\x9d club ?
 i was overcome with difficult-to-articulate feelings as we prepared to go home.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as a child i watched a hayley mills movie , the moon spinners , in which she and her friends get into mischievous escapades on greek hillsides dotted with windmills and the seed for seeing the world was sown .
 i read rebecca , the sun also rises , the talented mr. ripley , the sheltering sky and the drifters .
 they filled me with longing for adventure in other countries and the reverie of some day living abroad.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'at every opportunity \xe2\x80\x93 when pinching pennies , the family budget and work schedules allowed \xe2\x80\x93 joe and i took off for europe , visiting my beloved france , but also venturing to england , scotland , italy , germany , belgium and greece .
 we visited my sister peggy who lived in london with her husband for several years .
 we took the kids backpacking through italy and greece , starting in rome and heading all the way south to crete .
 we traveled with each other for international business conferences and made special anniversary trips for our 15th , 20th and 25th celebrations .
 but as lovely and exciting as these voyages were , they were short-lived and temporary .
 but we were determined not to relegate living in europe to the outer reefs of \xe2\x80\x9csomeday isle\xe2\x80\x9d along with all those other resolutions : someday i\xe2\x80\x99ll lose weight , start exercising , change jobs , visit friends more often , read anna karenina , take dancing lessons.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i vividly recall joe holding my hand , leaning over to me as our jet took off in 2001 for our 20th anniversary trip to france and saying , \xe2\x80\x9cjust imagine that those are one-way tickets in our backpacks and we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving to live for a full year abroad \xe2\x80\x93 how exciting will that be ? \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'so there we were in paris , after our long-awaited year abroad , poised for a ceremonial burning of clothes : joe\xe2\x80\x99s black sport coat worn to the point of translucence , my limp , green hiking pants devoid of any life they\xe2\x80\x99d once had and white t-shirts stained , gray and ragged from too many ineffective washings in the sink .
 perhaps it was time to go home , time to allow a bit more routine back into our lives , time to find a place to nest.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we would soon be back to the daily grind , in the clutches of the washington beltway bourgeoisie , subject to the incessant drumbeat of our modern world .
 i could see the stresses lurking just beyond the horizon back in the states , ready to pounce the moment we arrived .
 anything related to finding new employment and heading back to the frenzied reality of daily life made me anxious and prone to procrastination .
 we were resolute , however , about doing our best to resist the pressures and remain dispassionate about the day-to-day exigencies of life in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'thirty-one years after initially setting up housekeeping together , i thought about what a gift we\xe2\x80\x99d been handed : to once again start our lives anew .
 world-weary travelers , i knew we would delight in settling down , being rooted in the comfortable and mundane and anxious to loose ourselves in new routines , untested and pregnant with possibility .
 yes , we would get to begin again with no idea of where we would work or where we would live .
 we would have the ability to reinvent ourselves and our lives and play a whole new hand of cards .
 life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much luckier than that.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss being surrounded by languages other than our own every day , and french most of all \xe2\x80\x93 at the monoprix grocery store , listening to the news on la t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9 , on the metro and on the bus .
 i\xe2\x80\x99ll have to suffer through withdrawal , like an addict going cold turkey , as i distance myself from the pleasure that is france , the pleasure that is europe , the pleasure that is traveling.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'will we experience a bit of reverse culture shock on returning to the us ?
 will the frenetic pace of american life surprise us ? \xe2\x80\x9d will we ask : \xe2\x80\x9cwhy are these people walking so fast ? \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chow is it that we understand everything that\xe2\x80\x99s being said and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to frantically search for words to make ourselves clear ? \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do toilets flush with handles on the side and not buttons on the top ? \xe2\x80\x9d and last , but hardly least , \xe2\x80\x9cwhy are these portions so huge ? \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'after being foreigners for so long , we\xe2\x80\x99re certain to feel somewhat foreign ourselves despite being back in our own country .
 we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get used to reading signs in english and adjust to the daily visual parade of the morbidly obese , chronically loud and badly tattooed .
 and while i do love my country and our life in america , i do fear that in an acclimating fit of pique i may one day scream at my fellow citizens , \xe2\x80\x9dwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you be more like europeans ? \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'is there a new person who has emerged from her exploits across europe , wiping off the dust of magical places discovered ?
 perhaps i won\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer until we\xe2\x80\x99re back in the melee and i see how i deal with the everyday .
 but i experienced some revelations while we were away and chief among them is the reinforcement of the virtues of simplicity and kindness .
 there were times while traveling when we had an acute need for a kind gesture -- just a little one .
 and when it materialized in the form of a clerk\xe2\x80\x99s smile or a pedestrian who helped direct us , it made all the difference in the world.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i want my days to be filled with kind gestures \xe2\x80\x93 both those i offer and those i receive .
 at this time in my life , i\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in being with people i don\xe2\x80\x99t care for , who aren\xe2\x80\x99t kind and i\xe2\x80\x99m embarrassed to be at a table with in a restaurant because of how they treat the staff .
 the most important thing in human life is to be kind and i find i now have no tolerance for anyone who can not be so.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'one the eve of our departure , if someone had knocked on our apartment door and told us we were required to stay for another few months , smiles would have overwritten our leave-taking frowns .
 a few more months among the wonders of europe would have suited us just fine.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` but knowing we would be back on us turf and seeing our children , friends and family soon was not a bad thing either .
 going home is hard when you love where you 've been but being in the same country as our kids will make our hard landing a bit softer .
 it was hard on chris and caroline at times to have us so far away and while we\xe2\x80\x99re used to living apart , the wide atlantic ocean between us was a very real gulf that made the separation more acute.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to admit , but after 12 months of being on the road , my contentment pendulum had swung to the side of longing for a comfortable home base and the desire to settle down .
 moving into a place we can call our own , where we can unpack knowing that in a few days we will not have to repack yet again and where we can become reacquainted with those favorite things we left behind ( our bed , my coffee mug , the c & o canal and morning tv ) .\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'but i know myself well and the cozy complaisance of life in the familiar will only last for so long .
 my craving for novelty will once again wrestle with my very real desire for security .
 on some undetermined evening in the not-too-distant future over a glass wine in the corner of an evocative bistro , my always persistent wanderlust will poke through the fabric of our daily lives , and i will declare my need for some adventure , some movement , some discovery .
 and the determined planning for more travel will begin yet again.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' pictures of our adventures : http : //gapyeargirlgoestoeurope.shutterfly.com\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'you might also like : \r\n ' , 'le d\xc3\xa9part\r\n ' , 'sicily , then and now\r\n ' , 'race day ' ]

 [ 'date : 6/9/2015\r\n ' , 'page : http : //lifeonwilliemaelane.blogspot.com/2015/03/mobile-home-kitchen-remodel-update.html\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , ' birthday fun ! \r\n ' , 'happy birthday ... ..to me ! \r\n ' , `` and just like that ... it 's over ! \r\n '' , 'a blissful weekend\r\n ' , 'restoring my soul\r\n ' , 'sunday , march 22 , 2015\r\n ' , ' mobile home kitchen remodel update\r\n ' , 'hello friends !
 i wanted to give you a quick update on the progress of the kitchen remodel .
 we have been busy over the past few days .
 the hubby took off thursday and friday to work on it so we were able to get a lot done .
 friday was spent at the hardware store , lowes , home depot , and back at lowes .
 i am beginning to feel like those stores are my home away from home ... lol !
 by the way , if you have an ace hardware nearby , they have clark & kensington and valspar sample size cans of paint for $ 0.99 each which is a great deal .
 there is a limit of four , but i was able to get 12 with three transactions since the guys know my hubby so well .
 : ) i got some pretty colors to add to my craft stash for future projects .
 i think the offer is all month long .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i managed to make a pretty tasty supper tonight .
 we are tired of sandwiches , frozen pizza , and fast food !
 i made a sandwich we love ... it has applewood bacon , turkey , muenster cheese , chipotle mayo , fresh guacamole , and tomato on a toasted kaiser bun .
 served with some sweet tea and kettle chips , it was a tasty supper ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'anywho , let me show you what we have been up to !
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'you can see the wall color here .
 it is painted the same color as my dining and living rooms .
 it is a very nice neutral color and blends with everything .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'here are some of the upper cabinets installed .
 looking good ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'all the uppers installed here except the one that goes over the fridge that we have to order since they don\'t stock the size we need.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'we still have to put the new range hood up and finish some trim and of course the counter tops on this side.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'here is from across the room from my new wall that we built .
 it will have a raised bar top on it made from old lumber my grandpa cut years ago .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'here\ 's a better shot of that wall .
 my kitchen is larger now since we extended it out into the dining room about 2 feet .
 i can\'t believe how much bigger it feels ! please excuse the tools and mess everywhere and the dangling lights .
 i have all my new light fixtures but we won\'t install them until all the construction is done .
 don\'t want to risk them getting broken .
 there will be open shelves on the sides of the window.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'here\ 's another shot .
 the trim in the corner has been finished since this photo was taken .
 the plastic was still on the dishwasher in this photo as well .
 i am so excited about the counter space i am gaining in my new layout !
 please ignore the floor ... it will be the last thing we do.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'speaking of counters , let me give you a sneak peek at what i decided to use on them .
 if you\ 're a regular here , you know i wanted butcher block counters .
 well , i did a ton of research on them and just could not commit to them .
 they are beautiful but do require a lot of upkeep and i just don\'t want to have to worry about them .
 we also didn\'t want to drive all the way to tampa or orlando to get them .
 the hubby had suggested tile , but i was adamant that i did not want tile .
 nothing against it , it just wasn\'t the look i was going for .
 but then , the night after he suggested it , i had an epiphany !
 i thought , why not use wood look tile !
 tile is so easy and durable , not to mention cheaper than anything else , and the wood look tile is beautiful.\r\n ' , 'so , check it out ... ..\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` now this is n't installed , but i had to lay it out and see what it was going to look like .
 i am in love ! ! !
 it is exactly the look i was going for .
 i could n't be happier !
 i love the way the corner looks .
 i saw this idea online .
 what do you think ? \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'sadie thinks she is tired of the remodeling ... lol ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i was really hoping we would be finished before i go back to work tomorrow , but it\ 's ok. we have the hardest part done and after the counters are finished , it will just be finish work ... .lights , sink , shelving , pantry , floor , etc .
 i\ 'm so happy with it and can\'t wait to organize and decorate ! \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i hope you had a beautiful weekend and i hope your week is just as beautiful .
 i have a workshop in tampa on thursday , so several of the teachers and administrators from my school will be heading down there wednesday after school .
 i am hoping we can run to ikea so i can pick up a few goodies for the new kitchen , but it will depend on what the others want to do.\r\n ' , 'until next time ... . ' ]

 [ 'date : 6/9/2015\n ' , 'site : http : //keepingupwiththecyperts.blogspot.com/2013/06/that-one-time-i-met-taylor-swift.html\n ' , '\n ' , 'that one time i met taylor swift\n ' , '\n ' , 'i know !
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'i have drug this recap out to three posts now and i am finally getting around to how i met taylor .
 really , thank you for not yelling at me.\n ' , '\n ' , 'catch up here and here before reading this post .
 if you wanna.\n ' , '\n ' , 'so , last post i left you hanging with how we were chosen for club red and how meeting taylor went.\n ' , 'so here goes ... \n ' , '\n ' , `` i guess i should explain what club red is for those of you who are n't obsessed with taylor .
 after almost all of her shows , taylor has a club red .
 club red is basically a meet and greet but it lasts a little longer and only a select few are chosen from the crowd .
 inside club red there is pizza , cokes , candy , and several of her costumes are displayed from previous tours .
 about 20 to 25 people are chosen for each show .
 you are chosen from the crowd by taylor 's mom , andrea , or someone working with her .
 you can be chosen for many different reasons but being a crazy fan is helpful .
 and , apparently , it does n't matter where you are seated because we were at the very very top and were still chosen ! \n '' , '\n ' , 'during the lucky one , mom , alyssa , and i were singing along and waving around our sign .
 by this point i had quit thinking about club red and was enjoying the concert .
 this lady came up to us and was talking to mom so i leaned in to see what was going on .
 neither of us could hear her at all so i just smiled and said , `` yes '' .
 you know , the way you do when you have no clue what someone is saying .
 i thought she was asking to get by or something .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'then i heard her say the magical words , `` you are going to meet taylor after the show ! ''
 \n ' , '\n ' , `` y'all.\n '' , 'que the hysteria .
 i was a mess .
 \n ' , 'i started crying immediately , put my hand over my mouth , and shook my head in disbelief for a long time .
 i remember looking at my mom , telling her we got to meet taylor after the show and mom saying , `` ohh , whitney\ 's gon na cry !
 `` \n ' , '\n ' , 'damn straight i was going to cry.\n ' , ' i had been thinking about this moment for quite awhile , reading other people\ 's stories about getting into club red , and looking at their pictures in envy .
 i couldn\'t , and still can\'t , believe that we were chosen !
 out of 12,000 people , we were picked !
 it was the most excited i have ever felt .
 i called garrett at work and left him a message telling him that i was going to get to meet taylor .
 i was crying in that\n ' , `` sdessage .
 he has it on his phone still but i have yet to listen to it .
 i 'm generally not that excitable , so to feel such intense emotion that was uncontrollable was crazy to me .
 i 'm a pretty calm person most of the time.\n '' , ' \n ' , ' the lucky one was only the 5th song , so we still had quite some time to enjoy the concert .
 i wonder if they did that on purpose , choosing us during the lucky one ?
 i remember my mom saying , `` we\ 're the lucky ones ! ''
 still makes me giggle .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'alyssa and i couldn\'t stop grinning and intermittently getting teary eyed and saying , `` oh my god ! ''
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'even though i look scared in this picture , i wasn\'t .
 i had so many emotions running through my head and i guess this is the face i make when that happens .
 \n ' , 'see those red bracelets ?
 those mean club red.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i had seen so many pictures of that little note .
 to be holding my very own was surreal .
 mom held it at one point and pretended she lost it .
 goober.\n ' , '\n ' , 'after the concert we met in section 23/24 with the other people who had been chosen .
 the lady that chose us explained the rules to us : \n ' , '\n ' , '1 .
 take as many pictures as you want until taylor arrives .
 after that , put your camera up.\n ' , '2 .
 you are allowed one picture with taylor per group.\n ' , '3 .
 taylor will sign one thing per person.\n ' , '\n ' , `` we were led through the foyer and across the way to the building where club red was .
 there were security around us so that no one could sneak in and there were fans outside asking if they could go in .
 words ca n't express how lucky i felt to be in that line ! \n '' , '\n ' , 'we were the first ones in line , so we got some good pictures .\n ' , '\n ' , `` taylor 's cat meredith.\n '' , '\n ' , 'dresses from her speak now tour : \n ' , '\n ' , 'the girl that had chosen us from the crowd was in there as well so i went up to her , thanked her multiple times , and asked her what got us chosen .
 she said that andrea , taylor\ 's mom , had seen our sign during ed sheeran and had sent her to get us !
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'and then ... they announced that taylor was about to come in .
 i had been pretty nervous the whole time and when they said that i got even more nervous .
 taylor came in , as well as andrea , and said hi to the room and went to the first group .
 we weren\'t supposed to go up to her , they said `` she will come to you . ''
 so , we just waited until it was our turn ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'i approached andrea and told her that we were the ones with the `` meow '' sign and thanked her multiple times for choosing us .
 she said that she had thought about moving us up to the very first row but decided to save us for club red instead !
 i asked her for a picture and told her thank you several more times .
 \n ' , '\n ' , `` us with taylor 's mom ! \n '' , '\n ' , `` goodness !
 i ca n't believe i get to type this : \n '' , 'and then we met taylor !
 ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'she came up to us said , `` hey guys ! ''
 and gave each of us a big hug .
 it wasn\'t just a wimpy side hug either .
 it was a full on hug .
 i may or may not have made garrett recreate it so that i could show him the kind of hug we got .
 i did .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'we talked about how awesome she was that night , that i was going to her denver show as well and would be in the 4th row , paris and belgium , that she was excited for the dallas show because it was going to be big , and a couple of other things i can\'t remember .
 she told us she liked our shirts and cat ears , i told her that i had made her a shirt but , like an idiot , i had left it at alyssa\ 's apartment .
 figures .
 she said i got credit anyways .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'she asked if we wanted a picture and we got these with her : \n ' , '\n ' , 'she is tiny !
 i know she looks skinny on tv but i swear she is even skinnier in person .
 she was the same height as alyssa and i !
 : ) during our picture i said , `` you are so tiny ! ''
 she was like , `` well thank you !
 thank you for saying that . ''
 she was also so pretty .
 i swear that girl is flawless.\n ' , '\n ' , 'then she asked if we had anything we wanted her to sign .
 we each had her sign our tshirts .\n ' , '\n ' , 'we each got one more hug and then she was on to the next group .
 i swear it seemed like about 2 seconds total !
 she was really nice and seemed kind of quirky to me which made me like her even more .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'after the last group , taylor headed out to her tour bus and we were on our way home !
 the whole time we were there i kept telling myself , `` be in the moment .
 take it all in . ''
 i felt like i just couldn\'t .
 it felt surreal and like it was a dream .
 i know that sounds cheesy but that\ 's how it felt .
 i am so thankful to have had this opportunity and to have shared it with my mom and sister .
 it was fun seeing them get excited and i think they now have a better understanding of why i always advocate for taylor.\n ' , '\n ' , 'oh !
 and this happened : \n ' , '\n ' , 'taylor\ 's guitarist grant saw our sign !
 : ) exciiiiting .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'this sunday , garrett and i are going to see her in denver .
 he surprised me with vip tickets for christmas last year and we are going to be in the 4th row .
 i am so unbelievably excited !
 so , i apologize in advance for the amount of taylor pictures you have been , and will be , seeing from me .
 thanks for sticking with me !

 i love it , but i hate the battles with the kids some days .
 \n ' , '\n ' , `` it 's the first day of no school for me and the kids together.\n '' , '\n ' , 'so i laid down the ground rules.\n ' , '\n ' , `` 1 .
 10 minutes of instrument practice ( which they 're supposed to do anyway ) .\n '' , '\n ' , `` 2 .
 2 pages in the workbook they 're supposed to do for school this summer ( they had a similar workbook to do last summer from their aunt ) .\n '' , '\n ' , '3 .
 1-2 chores ( again , things they normally do ) .\n ' , '\n ' , 'they do these things and they can earn a little screen time ( unless they\ 've lost it for other reasons -- which they already have ) .
 when they\ 're all done then we can go do something -- like a bike ride , a trip to the beach , playing in the park with friends , etc .
 ultimately those three tasks can be done in thirty minute\ 's time.\n ' , '\n ' , 'however , we already started the day with a meltdown over those ground rules .
 `` you\ 're ruining summer . ''
 `` it\ 's supposed to be all about play . ''
 `` i\ 'm too tired to do those things ( my oldest son was at a sleepover last night -- how i hate the fallout from those ! ) .
 `` \n ' , '\n ' , `` well , this is it , kids .
 there may be circumstances were i budge on those rules , but it wo n't be often .
 i do n't care if your friends do n't have to do a single chore this summer .
 this is how we roll .
 i 'm all about having fun this summer , but you 've got to do your jobs.\n '' , '\n ' , 'posted by rev .
 dave at 11:51 am no comments : links to this post \n ' , 'thursday , february 6 , 2014\n ' , '\n ' , 'lasagna & olympics\n ' , 'the good folks at red gold sent me a promo pack with their signature canned tomato products , a box of lasagna noodles , and a nice spatula along with recipes for `` all-in-one lasagna '' .
 i\ 'm always up for a meal idea that i don\'t have to think about , so it was helpful to have a night where i didn\'t much have to think about making a meal .
 i just had to add in some mozzarella ( which we always have on hand ) and ricotta cheese ( which we usually would just use cottage cheese , but i went ahead and picked up a carton of ricotta on my last shopping trip ) .\n ' , '\n ' , 'i just used the basic recipe -- often when i\ 've made lasagna in the past i add in vegetables since my wife is vegetarian , but then the kids don\'t eat it very well ( no matter how hard i try to disguise the veggies ) .
 the basic lasagna -- just the noodles , tomato mixture , and cheeses -- was easy to make .
 i did it the night before ; the noodles didn\'t require precooking or anything .
 since we had a big pan of lasagna waiting in the fridge for us , and since the 2014 winter olympics were beginning , we decided to invite friends over for the night .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'a co-worker from school who has children my sons\ ' ages came over ( her husband was busy with an audit , unfortunately ) .
 it went over fairly well .
 the kids all ate it ( well , my youngest kind of had to be fed it , but that\ 's how he is ) .
 it would have been easy to make it with some tasty add-ins ( meat , veggies , etc .
 ) , but the basic one was quite tasty .
 i appreciate the recipes that red gold sent which are on their website and how it\ 's easy to play with the recipe to change things up .
 i hadn\'t tried crushed tomatoes before , but they worked really nicely mixed in with some diced tomatoes -- i\ 'll keep that idea in mind with future meals .
 a nice salad and brownies accompanied the meal.\n ' , '\n ' , 'then we watched some of the winter olympics .
 i don\'t normally watch much sports on television .
 the olympics is my one indulgence .
 it\ 's one of the few times our television is on several nights a week .
 this year the kids are old enough to start enjoying it , too .
 they both have worked with countries and their flags in school , so they\ 're enjoying picking out the countries as identified by their flags.\n ' , '\n ' , 'food and olympics .
 good times .
 thanks , red gold.\n ' , 'posted by rev .
 dave at 10:12 pm no comments : links to this post \n ' , 'wednesday , january 8 , 2014\n ' , '\n ' , 'the gratitude game : a solution to the grumbles\n ' , 'this was originally posted on my other blog , like the previous post was .
 but i thought it would go well on this one as well since it deals with parenting , so forgive me for posting it in two places.\n ' , '\n ' , ' \n ' , 'so yesterday i wrote a response to some of the complaining and grumbling i had seen around facebook due to a second cancelled day of school on the heels of christmas break .
 it gathered a few comments and reactions ( oddly , none were directly on the blog , but all on my facebook link to it ) .\n ' , '\n ' , 'admittedly , my children had been getting at each others\ ' throats for a few days .
 my wife connected it to when they found the old super nintendo , lugged it upstairs from its box in the basement , connected it to the television , and started playing .
 one controller was broken , so they could only play one player at a time .
 the non-playing brother would sit close by and offer `` helpful '' suggestions during play .
 which inevitably led to sore feelings and inappropriate comments toward one another.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i pointed out that it didn\'t matter if they were playing video games or not .
 they were getting to the point of verbal combat with one another over the simplest thing , electronic or not.\n ' , '\n ' , 'and i understand that this is why some parents hate an unexpected day off from school .
 especially on the heels of sixteen previous days .
 especially when we\ 've been in the midst of this `` polar vortex '' with -50 degree f windchill.\n ' , '\n ' , 'thankfully ( that word is about to come into play ) i remembered all the writing i\ 've done and all the conversations from friends about the importance of gratitude in one\ 's life .
 so yesterday , on our drive to the ymca for a little swimming ( and to get out of the house ) after a morning that wasn\'t completely pleasant around the house at times i made up a little game .
 it went like this : \n ' , '\n ' , ' '' okay , boys , we\ 're going to play a little game ( groans emerge from the back seat ) .
 each of us is going to think up something that completes the sentence `` i\ 'm grateful for ... or i\ 'm thankful for ... '' ( more groans ) .
 i\ 'll start and then i\ 'll count to five and then anders has to share something before i finish counting .
 after he shares then it\ 's on to nils who has to share something before i count to five .
 then it\ 's back to me and we keep going .
 but if anyone doesn\'t think up something before i count to five , they\ 're out .
 i\ 'll give you a few seconds to think up at least two things your thankful for before i start .
 `` \n ' , '\n ' , 'by this time the moans had diminished and they were beginning to take it seriously .
 so i started .
 and the gratitude kept going around.\n ' , '\n ' , 'some were serious : i\ 'm grateful for a warm house ; i\ 'm thankful that the gas tank is full so i don\'t have to pump gas in this cold ; i\ 'm thankful for our y membership right now ; i\ 'm grateful for the food we have to eat.\n ' , '\n ' , 'some were more frivolous : i\ 'm thankful for root beer ; i\ 'm grateful for candy ; i\ 'm thankful for legos ; i\ 'm grateful for that i won milles bornes ( the card game ) .\n ' , '\n ' , `` i had to mail a package at the post office on the way , so i had to pause the game then .

 this is on top of christmas break , so we\ 're looking at nearly 2 1/2 weeks at home with the kids .
 yesterday\ 's windchill dipped to -50 degrees fahrenheit .
 it\ 's cold here .
 we\ 've been trapped inside .
 we all need to move a little more.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i could participate in the trend i see on facebook : complaining about having to be around my kids these two extra days because we\ 're all going stir-crazy .
 yes , i\ 'm tired of their complaining -- especially when asked to do a chore .
 yes , i\ 'm tired of their arguing with each other -- especially when one is playing a video game and the other is trying to be `` helpful '' ( yesterday they were each allowed 15 minutes of video game time and even then it resulted in tears ) .
 yes , i\ 'm tired of being inside , too , feeling like there\ 's nothing to do even though there is plenty.\n ' , '\n ' , `` but complaining only breeds contempt .
 and while my children are n't on facebook right now , they will be someday .
 what kind of message would that send to them ?
 yes , kids , we brought you into this world and love you dearly , but i ca n't stand spending time with you ... \n '' , '\n ' , 'do they hear my grumbling or do they see my gratitude ? \n ' , '\n ' , 'gratitude ?
 of course .
 at least i can strive to have more gratitude than grumbling in my life ... \n ' , '\n ' , 'gratitude that i am able to be home with them on these cold days and not struggling to find child care to shuffle them off to .
 gratitude that they had some time helping their mom bake cookies and getting to learn some kitchen skills .
 gratitude that we had a little extra time together .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'yes , we may get cabin fever and get a little stir-crazy , but how about using that extra energy toward some creative things to do together ( and i fully admit that i don\'t always do this -- that sometimes it\ 's easier to do my own distraction and let the boys do theirs ) ?
 we did some cold experiments yesterday ( along with half the facebook population in the midwest ) .
 we threw boiling water in the air to see what happened ( it was cool , but not as impressive as we thought it might be ) .
 we put a plate of dish-soap bubbles outside .
 we tried blowing bubbles to see them freeze ( most popped before they froze ) .
 we had friends who froze a t-shirt and broke it in half and who played ice-bowling .
 it\ 's too cold to be outside for long , but it\ 's perfectly fine for short periods of time.\n ' , '\n ' , 'how about teaching children a new skill in the kitchen ?
 or having them help with a project that requires tools ?
 or simply doing some household chores together ?
 our boys enjoyed simply pulling off the blue trim tape after a painting project.\n ' , '\n ' , 'so many people are on pinterest , that i\ 'm sure there\ 's plenty of great things to try with children there ( i haven\'t opened up that time-distraction -- i\ 've got enough as it is ! ) .
 my boys have filled up several pages in the sketch books they received in their stockings at christmas .
 my youngest is creating things with duct tape .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'we haven\'t really had much screen time ( mainly because they\ 've lost some of it from bad attitudes ; if we hadn\'t been coming off a two week break , we maybe would have considered a movie marathon , but we\ 'd already watch several movies at night in the past few weeks ) , but we\ 've played plenty of board and card games .
 and of course , there\ 's plenty of reading adventures !
 sometimes we take a break and all read together ( last year we read through the hobbit during one evening a week ) .\n ' , '\n ' , 'maybe a good project together is to make a collage of things you are thankful for .
 gratitude might just be a better way to spend a day rather than grumbling.\n ' , '\n ' , 'with that said , we\ 're about to try and get the car started so we can go to the ymca .
 my youngest will complain about the temperature of the water in the swimming pool ( the child has zero body fat which is to his detriment for swimming time ) .
 but i\ 'm grateful we have a car we can travel with , i\ 'm grateful that we have a few months of y membership , i\ 'm grateful we can exercise together , and i\ 'm grateful the gas tank is full enough that i don\'t have to stop and fill it in the cold.\n ' , '\n ' , 'hopefully i can pass some of that gratitude on to my sons .

 in the past we 've let them invite one friend for each year of age .
 last year he invited 8 friends over .
 this year , since he 's getting bigger , we gave the option of having a sleepover .
 we mutually decided that two friends was a good start for the first non-family sleepover.\n '' , '\n ' , 'we did it simple and low-key , but i think everyone had fun ( except for the friend who was homesick and went home before anyone was asleep , but he knew coming into the party that he would have a hard time staying away from home -- and he had fun except for bed-time ) .
 \n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' , `` personally , i think a lot of birthday parties have gotten out of control .
 it 's great to celebrate and have fun , but we 're not going to spend a few hundred dollars on a party .

 they mainly want to hang out with friends anyway ( okay , maybe open some presents , too ) .\n '' , '\n ' , 'so we did a grilled supper outside .
 the birthday `` cake '' was a frozen fruit bar.\n ' , '\n ' , 'it has become a tradition , i guess , that we make an obstacle course in the yard .

 we told them the rule of the house was not to wake anyone else up -- if you\ 're the first one up and don\'t want to try and get back to sleep , you\ 're welcome to go downstairs and have a bite to eat ( fruit and cereal was on the table ) and play .
 once everyone was up , we did the real breakfast.\n ' , '\n ' , `` it also turned out that it was the kid 's workshop day at home depot , so we headed there and did their building project.\n '' , '\n ' , 'simple .

 [ 'date : 6/9/2015\n ' , 'site : http : //theboslife.blogspot.com/2015/04/my-26th-surprise.html\n ' , '\n ' , 'my 26th !
 a surprise ! \n ' , 'my 26th birthday landed on a monday this year and as a result fernando claimed he wanted to go out on a date the saturday before to celebrate .
 what was really happening , unbeknownst to me was the planning of a surprise birthday party ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'my friend ana contacted fernando and asked if he thought it was a good idea to plan a surprise party for my birthday .
 he of course said yes and they went to planning .
 ana and juan generously hosted the party ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'first we had dinner at our house with nonna , nonno , laura and svet .
 then laura and svet claimed they needed to get going and left right after dinner was over .
 shortly after fernando and i went on our way with ( what i thought was ) our plans for dessert .
 nonno and nonna stayed to babysit the girls and we headed out .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'when we got in the car fernando told me i needed to put my scarf over my eyes and cover them all the way to our destination .
 he said he wanted the dessert place we were going to be a surprise .
 at this point i still wasn\'t suspicious .
 this is the kind of stuff fernando does randomly so i definitely didn\'t think it was a surprise party !
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'when we pulled up to the place and fernando said `` okay , we\ 're here ! ''
 i knew something was up .
 it was obvious he pulled into a driveway and not a restaurant parking lot .
 then he opened up a door ( which was obviously to someone\ 's home ) and had me walk in .
 when i took off the scarf we were in ana\ 's house !
 there were a bunch of my friends there saying `` surprise . ''
 and i most definitely was surprised !
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'laura and svet were supposed to be there when we showed up but they came shortly after .
 they walked in with wine to share and some special chocolates for me ( to not share ; ) !
 they also had the birthday cake and some cheese , crackers and fruit which fernando went out to grab earlier in the day without me knowing it !
 he got my favorite lemon cake from nantucket grill with the sweetest message on it !
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'i guess when laura and svet left our house they grabbed the cake and other things from the trunk of fernando\ 's car since they were supposed to show up at the party before us .
 ( they needed to stop for wine on the way so that\ 's why we ended up beating them there . )
 either way all of the goodies got there and there was a great group of people there to celebrate !
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'this was my first surprise birthday party !
 i felt so blessed to have such a great friend to think of/plan/host the party , an amazing husband to pull off all the last minute details and such great family and friends to celebrate with !
 \n ' , ' \n ' , ' laura is the only lady missing from this picture ! !
 ( we took it after she left ) \n ' , `` ( and all of these lovely lady 's husbands/fianc\xc3\xa9s were there as well !
 ) \n '' , '\n ' , 'now on to my actual birthday !
 \n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' , ' since we had already celebrated my birthday plenty over the weekend i figured that was it as far as presents went ... so i was surprised to find this book wrapped in a bow with a sweet note from fernando the morning of my birthday !
 i had told him i wanted this book back in january but had all but forgotten about it .
 i have heard great things about it and am excited to start reading it !
 \n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' , 'my coffee and treat c/o nonna and nonno babysitting ! \n ' , '\n ' , 'about mid morning on my birthday nonna called me and said she scheduled a facial for me at 1pm .
 she then showed up with nonno to watch the girls so i could go enjoy my facial .
 she handed me 10 bucks and said `` this is for the tip '' and then another 10 and said `` this is for a fancy coffee and i don\'t want to see you back here before 4 . ''
 aka : what every mother of young children wants to hear.\n ' , '\n ' , 'i had never gotten a facial so this was a special experience .
 it was amazing ! \n ' , '\n ' , ' ( on the form you fill out before getting a facial it asks if you\ 've ever had a facial before .
 the lady giving the facial read on the form that this was my first and she asked me `` you\ 've never had a facial before ? ! ? ''
 and looked at me like i had 3 heads .
 it was as if i told her i\ 've never had chocolate before .
 ) \n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' , 'my sweet friend ashley sent me a birthday package !
 i was so surprised with the present and how thoughtful each item was .
 she sent all these adorable things- plus the ones in the cute bags are homemade granola and homemade chocolate fudge ! \n ' , 'so delicious and so thoughtful !
 thanks again ash ! \n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' ]

 [ 'date : 6/9/2015\n ' , 'site : http : //mottmultiples.blogspot.com/\n ' , '\n ' , 'wednesday , may 20 , 2015\n ' , 'twins..triplets and a single..getting busy with life ! \n ' , 'i settled into bed on sunday evening at an early hour .
 the weekend was overwhelming and i think i ate most of my meals on the road .
 it was not a family vacation or anything but rather the life of a chauffeur mom .
 we sent everyone in for showers early on sunday evening with the hopes of the house shutting down early.\n ' , '\n ' , 'we covered lots of highway miles , 5 hockey games , 2 baseball games , tennis practice , a 5k run and a date night on saturday .
 i laid down and got all covered up and cozy .
 my intent was to let my eyes roll back in my head and drift into a deep slumber .
 as soon as i hit the pillow my brain did the opposite .
 what is ahead of me this week ?
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'are all of the carpools set up ?
 \n ' , `` is colin 's eye doctor appointment going to conflict with my volunteering in the classroom ?
 \n '' , 'wait ... is david working late any night this week ?
 \n ' , 'i need to order the mulch !
 \n ' , 'oh shoot i still need to send an email out about the hosting of the families at the homeless shelter .
 \n ' , 'i really need to get the summer clothes out for the triplets .
 \n ' , 'did i change that last load of laundry ?
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'needless to say i leaned over and told david , `` i will be back later , i need to gather my thoughts for the week '' .
 i needed to sit down and get the calendars out and write out all the requirements for the week .
 i am still a little old fashioned in the spring when we are overbooked .
 i keep everything in my phone on my calendar but there is something to be said about having it all written out so you can see the week in a glance and really see any gaps in the schedule .
 our biggest issue that now we have the triplets doing activities .
 if everyone has an event on a single night i am just out of people .
 it takes some patience and the ability to ask for help to be able to juggle and balance this interesting 6 week time period in the spring .
 liam plays baseball and the triplets also play baseball .
 eamon and liam play spring hockey .
 mairin does swim and tennis .
 eamon and liam also participate in the 7th grade tennis team thru school .
 some of the frustration comes with the overlapping of the seasons .
 baseball is wrapping up and swim tune up is beginning .
 spring hockey is ending but tennis has another week .
 \n ' , 'spring dinnertime is rough .
 i have to come up with dinners that can sit on the stove and pick items that the kids will eat warm or cold .
 taco pie and blueberry pie was sitting on the stove last night for all of the shifts coming and going .
 by the time i arrived home half of it was gone and it was still being eaten .
 i can\'t keep up with the stains on the clothes and the kids are spending their evenings running around during the baseball games or hockey games .
 there is not a lot of home time for the triplets because they usually have to ride with me to the events .
 they never understand why they can\'t watch tv before bed on the nights when we don\'t get home until dark .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'i finish the organizing of my thoughts at the kitchen table around 11:30pm on sunday night .
 it was all i could do to make it back up the stairs and crawl into bed .
 monday proved to be a great morning because i had the week in a snapshot in my head and we ready to take on the week .
 \n ' , '\n ' , `` monday night we had an amazing experience .
 our church hosts 35 homeless people from the south oakland homeless shelter every year for a week .
 we provide the food for 3 meals a day .
 they sleep at the our parish and we provide everything they need .
 our parish volunteers to take the people to their jobs , schools or to the shelters during the day and they all come back in the evenings .
 we decided to take on the dinner for monday evening .
 i grabbed 4 other families from our parish and we got together to make a taco night with all the fixings .
 the mom 's made the food but the kids all served the dinner , helped clean up and then entertained the kids for the evening .
 it was so enjoyable for all of us and definitely something we will do again in the future.\n '' , '\n ' , 'posted by heather mott at 2:11 pm no comments : links to this post\n ' , 'email this\n ' , 'blogthis ! \n ' , 'share to twitter\n ' , 'share to facebook\n ' , 'share to pinterest\n ' , '\n ' , 'friday , april 24 , 2015\n ' , 'twins , triplets and single ... .deals and dramas\n ' , 'we take up a whole row .
 we need a bigger than average kitchen table .
 we can\xe2\x80\x99t take other kids with us because our vehicle is at capacity .
 the benefits and the downfalls of a big family .
 family memberships to the zoo are beneficial to families like mine .
 we can more than pay for a year membership in just a single visit .
 family discounts benefit us sometimes when they make prices lower after child number 4 .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'every time we go to sign the kids up for an event and the price seems reasonable it is when you have to double or triple it and you start to get nauseous .
 people always tell me about the cute little markets that they shop at and all the cool types of food they have .
 i have walked into these stores and quickly remember why costco and sam\xe2\x80\x99s club are my trusty go to options .
 i buy a dozen boxes of cereal when they are on sale because we are easily a box a morning .
 i stop at the outlets on my way up north because pepper ridge farms has all of their bread next to the counter priced at 1.00 per loaf .
 i will take bags of bread home and freeze .
 i always say it is not so much the cost but the amount of storage needed for a big family .
 i have a make shift pantry out in the garage where i can stock my dry goods and mostly it is stocked due to really good sales that i need to take advantage of .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'easter is always interesting .
 our church is never full enough to where you can\xe2\x80\x99t find a seat but on easter you have to make sure and get there early in order to grab a seat .
 this is especially true for us because the 8 of us take up an entire row .
 the holidays ( no matter which one it is ) is always exhausting because the amount of work that goes into getting everyone dressed and ready in their fancy clothes is quite an undertaking .
 eamon wears a different size than liam does and they both have different size jackets .
 the shoes if not worn in awhile could be too small and as they are complaining that their feet are curled up at the end i am saying , \xe2\x80\x9cdeal with it , we are out of options and i have to move on and get the triplets dressed\xe2\x80\x9d .
 there are 5 ties to be tied and putting together enough belts to match and fit is always a problem .
 they always disappear .
 then it is just when you are walking out to the car and you notice that liam didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to his dad\xe2\x80\x99s drawer and get a pair of black socks but that he is sporting those flouresent under armor socks that are peaking thru the gap of his khakis that could argueably be almost too short .
 we can not get the triplets dressed to early because they will ruin their outfits in no time .
 we came home from a 1st communion just the other night and as i was washing the clothes i had 2 dress shirts with rips in the arms , 1 dress shirt with orange marker on it , a blazer with a missing button ( grrrrrrr ) and 3 pairs of dress pants with grass stains on them .
 another day\xe2\x80\xa6..\n ' , '\n ' , 'posted by heather mott at 11:04 am 2 comments : links to this post\n ' , 'email this\n ' , 'blogthis ! \n ' , 'share to twitter\n ' , 'share to facebook\n ' , 'share to pinterest\n ' , '\n ' , 'saturday , march 28 , 2015\n ' , 'the spring dance\n ' , 'the snow is melting and everything here in michigan is looking grey and very drab .
 spring is around the corner but if you look outside you just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it is close .
 the only way to really begin anticipating spring is to see all the spring goods in the stores and take advantage of the increased hours of daylight .
 kids are starting their baseball season and everyone is scheduling around march madness .
 it is time for all of the spring sports to begin and for those of us hockey families , it is the beginning of the spring dance .
 you would not understand it if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t experience it .
 you probably won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me when i explain it .
 those of you reading who are in hockey will get it and those of you who are not will question why in the heck do you participate in such craziness .
 my husband calls it the spring dance and i think it is a very fitting name for what is about to occur.\n ' , '\n ' , 'we dedicate ourselves to a season of hockey that runs august through march .
 we become friends with the other parents on our team because we spend more time together than we do with anyone else .
 we are on the ice 3 days a week and often will add a game or conditioning session in there somewhere .
 we all sit together and cheer on our boys .
 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to know each kid and know how they skate and what their number is .
 you start to cheer on all the kids on your team and celebrate their victories as if they are all your own children .
 your heart drops when one gets injured and you feel like it is your own .
 you spend weekends together either in hotels or locally waiting for the games to start .
 some rinks stink and leak and some are wonderful .
 we enjoy finding restaurants that will take a reservation for 40 after a tournament game .
 i have witnessed hide and go seek in meijers ( just to kill some time in between games ) , skating parties on our pond or other man made arenas in backyards .
 i have watched 12 year old boys say dumb things and make messes while showing off in front of their friends at a hockey dinner .
 i have carpooled with different families and have visited many team members homes for team gatherings .
 my boys have made so many friends throughout the years of hockey and we have learned to never burn a bridge as you will probably share a team with that person again in the future .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'we never dreamed we would be a hockey family .
 we never played hockey and we really never had friends who played .
 all it took was a neighbor who had a son 6 years older than my oldest who asked if they could use the pond in our backyard to skate on , one winter 8 years ago .
 the boys put on their skates and watched the neighbor boy and it was over .
 they learned to skate on our pond and wanted more .
 we started with a tot hockey program and proceeded to play house for 2 years .
 the boys improved and we decided to join the ranks of the crazy people and dove into a \xe2\x80\x9cbeginner travel team\xe2\x80\x9d .
 by beginner i mean \xe2\x80\x9ca glorified house team with more ice time\xe2\x80\x9d .
 we never traveled very far and the cost was reasonable .
 most of all the boys loved it .
 they always kept excellent grades and never ever complained about an early practice or having to miss something because of hockey .
 they love it , they crave it and they want more of it .
 eamon always says , \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing better than a weekend with a hockey tournament and i can be on the ice all weekend\xe2\x80\x9d we don\xe2\x80\x99t plan much in the winter months because hours are spent on the pond skating .
 i usually snow blow while the kids are at school and then they come out after school and shovel so that the puck will skim across the ice .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'let\xe2\x80\x99s talk more about the dance .
 the season often ends mid march and it is not a week later that tryouts are upon us .
 the spring hockey season is short..about 6 to 8 weeks .
 it can be a critical time to make moves because you can better secure your fall spot if you choose that team in the spring .
 you will see talent move from one team to another year after year .
 i once heard a coach say that the best part of hockey was the end of the season when the coaches would fight and steal kids and the mystery and anticipation of what team will end up being the best .
 spring is the only time you can double roster and the coaches carry bigger teams .
 you could also call it an extended tryout .
 end of february and beginning of march is when everyone shuts down .
 people don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about what they are going to do .
 there is no talk of staying on the team or leaving .
 the funny part is that most people won\xe2\x80\x99t ask others what they are doing either .
 it is a very weird secret time in the hockey world .
 this is when teams can fall apart .
 there are times when groups get together and will all leave together..secretly .
 there is also lots of talk about who is at tryouts .
 you could happen to run into someone at a tryout who is on your team and it is usually an awkward moment .
 people will often talk about who they saw at another tryout and everyone is always at tryouts to see who is showing up .
 \xe2\x80\x9cis there any new talent coming to our tryouts\xe2\x80\x9d is a common question among the men folk .
 you will see a cluster of dads standing around acting like they have to be there for their kids tryout but secretly none of them let their wives take the kids because this is like a prime time social event , a presidential ball where your child is being presented on the ice and everyone is watching .
 don\xe2\x80\x99t let any dad fool you that they are not reliving their childhood and experiencing an adrenaline rush just being there for their kids .
 \n ' , '\n ' , 'after try outs everyone goes about their business and it is only until all the tryouts are closed and the rosters are posted do you really know what people are doing .
 every year we are usually blown away with some of the moves but i guess this is part of the game of hockey .
 this is the part that stresses me out the most .
 some years we spend time deciding what to do and some years we don\xe2\x80\x99t try out for any teams other than our current one .
 this year was the year we chose to entertain some tryouts .
 it brought back the stress and the anxiety .
 the little\xe2\x80\x99s are getting older and they are now doing their own sports and we were playing on a team that was a solid 30 minutes away .
 we have 2 teams that are literally in our backyard and we wanted to check them out .
 spring is by far , the craziest time of the year for my family and requires david and me to coordinate schedules and be on our a game .
 i have recently added all the upcoming events to my calendar and have realized that i will have to enlist a fellow driver to help us out this year .
 there are too many evenings when we have 3 places to be.\n ' , '\n ' , '\n ' , 'in the end after several weeks of trying out and talking about things we decided that we will be making a move for spring to a team that might ( and i stress might ) be a little bit better than our current team and it is for sure a lot closer ( 11 minutes away ) .
 we did the dance this year .
 we made our commitment this past sunday to a new team and although we disappointed some people and surprised others we are happy with our decision because it was right for our family . ' ]

 i don\'t know that i\ 'm particularly qualified to give advice on any of those , but i thought it might be a fun idea to do a small business series on the \'ol blog and talk about my experience as a ( very ) small business owner .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'a good place to start is at the beginning .
 why i started willow crowns .
 if you\ 've been hanging around here for long , you know it\ 's a focus of my instagram and a big part of my day to day life , which is something i really never expected.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'let me be super honest .
 i expected being a stay at home mom to completely fulfill me .
 i don\'t know why , since i had no experience with it , but i just kind of assumed it would be everything i needed/wanted and that it would be great not to have to `` go to work '' every day.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the first thing i learned is that motherhood is work .
 whether you leave the house or don\'t , have a full time job outside of parenting or not , it\ 's hard work and that you can\'t phone it in .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'the second thing i learned is that it didn\'t completely fulfill me .
 don\'t get me wrong and don\'t get all riled up .
 i absolutely love staying home with my daughter and if i could only choose to do one thing , that\ 's what i\ 'd be doing , hands down .
 i would never trade this job and try to remember how lucky i am to have it , but there was a definite longing for something else that was coexisting with my love of motherhood.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'around the time o was 10 months old , i started to miss doing non mom things and feeling like i wanted to do something for myself .
 i think a big part of it was that i was two months into our move to texas .
 getting to know new people has never been a real strength of mine so i was pretty lonely in a brand new place with a husband who worked a lot .
 we were feeling stressed from buying our first home , a little isolated , ryan\ 's new job was kicking his butt , and it was honestly a really hard time for us .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i was already making ( the crappiest ) little headbands for liv ( because i was going to punch the next person to tell me what a beautiful little boy i had ) , and thought i may as well see if i could sell some on etsy .
 maybe i could contribute a tiny bit financially , be creative , and have something that was mine .
 it was what i did during naps , late at night when i was still home alone with the baby , and it was really therapeutic .
 my early efforts were beyond embarrassing and if you bought something during those early days , i\ 'm really really sorry .
 \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i really didn\'t know if it would grow or be a total dud , but it kind of didn\'t matter at the time .
 it was cathartic and gave me something to focus on besides the stress and unhappiness we were working through .
 it made me a better mom because i was doing something for myself , so i felt like i had more to give when it was `` mom time '' .
 does that make sense ? \r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'so that\ 's how willow crowns was born .
 crowns because duh , they\ 're headbands and willow for the name of the street i grew up on , the little piece of home i really needed at the time.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'pin on pinterest\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` a couple of ideas i have for future posts are how i grew the business , talking about branding , time management while still being a full time stay at home mom , and anything else you 'd like to know !
 let me know in the comments if there 's something you 'd like to hear about related to wc or being a small business owner !
 \r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'xoxo\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` p.s .
 steph has posted a live stream of her thoughts/actions from our spring launch today and i think it 's a fun read if you 're interested ! '' ]

 [ 'date : 6/25/2015\r\n ' , 'site : http : //fforfood.blogspot.com/2013/09/im-dog-walker.html\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` i 'm the dog walker.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` oddly enough , i 've been to very few weddings .
 a lot of people complain about weddings , like they 're a drag or something .
 i love them .
 i love looking at all of the people , watching the families interact , figuring out who knows whom , who tolerates whom , you get the idea .
 i love to watch the eccentric great aunt with her shaky , little hands , clutching her champagne glass smeared with red lipstick smudges around the rim and crumbs of god knows what permanently lodged in the corners of her mouth .
 i love the awkward little children , dressed up like adults , the boys looking miserable and uncomfortable and the girls loving their princess hair and dresses and all of the attention .
 i love watching the bride 's second cousin flirting with the groom 's best man 's brother , and sneaking off to hook up after just enough champagne , wine and cocktails to chalk it up to 'weddings'.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , `` i love the formality , the process .
 i love watching the groom 's face , and see his eyes light up ( or fill with tears ) when he first lays eyes on his very soon-to-be-bride walking down the aisle toward him .
 and , at that moment , i always cry a little .
 i love how awkward they are .
 i love that as a result of how awkward they are , and how no one really knows anyone all that well , no one is really themselves ; rather people take on a veil of anonymity .
 and pretty much everyone over indulges in some way or another.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'i love wedding food .
 i love food in chafing dishes .
 i love the taco themes , or the tapas themes , the big-fat-greek-wedding themes , i love choosing either the salmon or the roast beef .
 i love the over cornstarchy , congealed sauce that is poured over either one .
 i love the extremeley cooked carrots and green beans with mashed potatoes and gravy .
 and , of course , i love the cake.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` it 's wonderful that everyone dances ( to all manner of bad music ) .
 everyone laughs .
 everyone cries .
 everyone talks .
 everyone eats and everyone drinks .
 family and friends from all over the country , or even the world , perfect strangers , yet all thrust together because of another couple 's union .
 and everyone at least pretends to be happy , jubilant even .
 until they receive the next wedding invitation whereupon they complain what a drag weddings are.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'it had been at least five years since my last wedding , until this past weekend .
 one of my clients was getting married .
 and she wanted her dog , giovanni , to be in the wedding .
 to be specific , she wanted me to escort giovanni to the wedding and make sure he made it down the aisle with his `` grandfather '' ( the bride\ 's dad ) .
 an ordinary day .
 giovanni is an awesome dog and i adore him .
 giovanni is a pug .
 it was a hot day : giovanni mouth breathes like a pug , is a tiny bit chubby , and does not love the heat.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'i followed the wedding planners\ ' instructions to the t : i drove giovanni downtown at five pm and parked outside the venue .
 we were escorted in by one of the planners ; i then waited to hand him off to the bride\ 's father at the proper time .
 oh , did i mention giovanni was wearing a tuxedo ?
 a snug tux at that -- couldn\'t fasten the bottom button .
 so here i am in downtown la at 5 pm on what seemed the hottest day of the year with a chubby pug in a tux .
 after giovanni\ 's down the aisle promenade with granddad i was to take him and wait until the conclusion of the ceremony at which point the wedding photographer was going to get a few shots of the happy couple with giovanni .
 then gio and i were free to go.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` everything went as planned .
 except there were no side aisles .
 so for the first few moments of the ceremony , i sat in the very front row , next to the vips and the parents , who must have wondered who this bold stranger might be .
 i quietly explained , \xe2\x80\x9ci 'm the dog walker\xe2\x80\x9d , and they seemed relieved .
 so , gio 's granddad walked his daughter and her dog down the aisle and it was touching .
 as always , while everyone else was craning their necks to catch that first glimpse of the bride , i watched the groom 's face , and could tell exactly when he laid eyes on her , in her dress , for the first time .
 and i cried a little.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` after that , giovanni was quickly handed to me and , while the ceremony began to hit its stride , i had to awkwardly duck back up the center aisle , the only aisle .
 the very aisle that still had the lingering scent of the bride 's perfume as she had just walked down it not six seconds prior .
 and , of course , with giovanni panting very audibly in his tuxedo .
 a graceful exit it was not.\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'then , gio and i were shown to a corner in the back of the reception area to wait for the ceremony to end .
 a couple of the caterers and staff were curious about what we were doing back there , all alone , no champagne .
 \xe2\x80\x9ci\ 'm the dog walker , '' i told them.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , `` then , as fast as it began , it was over .
 and while giovanni was photographed with his just married mom and dad , i waited by the front door of the venue with the valets .
 then a woman stepped outside for some air and since we were the only non-valets standing there , she felt compelled to say , \xe2\x80\x9chi , i 'm evelyn , the groom 's sister .
 are you with bride or groom ? \xe2\x80\x9d to which i confidently replied , \xe2\x80\x9chi , i 'm the dog walker ! \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n '' , '\r\n ' , 'and so , as the bride and groom went back inside to enjoy the reception , the meal , the dancing and the champagne with all of their family and friends , giovanni and i hopped back in the car to head back to my house to relax .
 and man , was he happy to get that tux off.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'back at my place , it was dinner time .
 i fed the pups their kibble and fred poured us a couple of glasses of vino verde to sip while we got to our saturday night project : making ricotta , which was something i had wanted to do for a very long time \xe2\x80\x93 ever since i saw the recipe in saveur six or so years ago and ripped out the pages .
 as the milk and cream were heating up on the stove , i told him about how it felt so strange to have been a part , in even the tiniest way , of one of the most important days in two people\ 's lives , but to have been so very invisible .
 i wasn\'t really even there .
 and i didn\'t mind one bit \xe2\x80\x93 though a glass of champagne would have been much appreciated.\r\n ' , '\r\n ' , 'as we sat down to the table to eat our dinner of grilled pork tenderloin ( with an amazing dry rub ) and zucchini with ni\xc3\xa7oise olives and homemade ricotta , i realized i definitely got my wedding fix .
 i got the vibe .
 i watched the families , the couples , the singles scoping out their next flirt target .
 there was champagne , and spicy margaritas .
 it was a taco theme , with mariachis and the whole bit .
 i did what most women who have not yet had their own wedding do ( and have thought about since they were six years old ) , compare it to what they would do differently , take note of what worked , little details , d\xc3\xa9cor , style , all of it .
 and before giovanni and i left , i did get a hug from the bride and groom \xe2\x80\x93 which is actually pretty hard to get at a lot of weddings , with all of the hullabaloo .
 especially for the dog walker ' ]
