'This
is
my
sixth
life
.
Or
is
it
seventh
?
When
we
move
to
a
new
city
,
especially
if
it\xe2\x80\x99s
abroad
,
it
often
feels
like
we
started
living
a
completely
new
life
.
Like
we
are
a
different
person
compared
to
the
one

'Living
in
a
foreign
place
feels
much
different
than
going
there
as
a
tourist
.
As
a
tourist
,
it
seems
much
harder
to
experience
the
way
the
foreign
culture
breaths
and
it\xe2\x80\x99s
much
harder
to
find
the
nooks
and
crannies
which
locals
are
well
aware
of
.
But
immersing
myself
in
another
culture
was
a
worthwhile
,
mind
expanding
experience.\r\n
'
,
'I\xe2\x80\x99ve
asked
myself
why
that
is
,
what
happens
when
we
move
to
a
new
city
?
\r\n
'
,
'We
get
shocked
out
of
our
minds.\r\n
'
,
'Literally
.
I
could
not
have
imagined
a
scene
like
this
in
my
wildest
dreams
,
even
though
we\xe2\x80\x99ve
all
heard
stories
of
how
liberal
Dutch
people
are
:
imagine
a
coffee
shop
in
which
one
could
enjoy
cannabis
is
placed
in
the
heart
of
Amsterdam
city
,
right
next
to
a
church
,
which
is
sitting
comfortably
next
to
Amsterdam\xe2\x80\x99s
famous
red
light
district
filled
with
ladies
of
the
night
seductively
trying
to
beckon
you
over
,
all
the
while
kids
are
walking
about
the
premises
minding
their
own
business.\r\n
'
,
'Seeing
something
so
far
out
of
what
my
surroundings
taught
me
right
has
shocked
me
and
made
me
smile
at
the
same
time
.
It
helped
me
grow
because
I
realized
that
nothing
is
inherently
good
or
bad
,
it\xe2\x80\x99s
only
our
perceptions
that
make
it
so.\r\n
'
,
'My
mind
was
also
blown
during
the
first
few
encounters
with
Asian
traffic
,
which
made
me
feel
like
I
was
the
frog
from
Frogger
,
the
classic
arcade
game.\r\n
'
,
'Getting
shocked
out
of
our
minds
is
eye
opening
for
a
few
reasons
:
\r\n
'
,
'1
.
We
live
in
the
moment
much
more
often
,
without
even
trying
.
When
I
am
shocked
,
I
have
no
time
to
think
.
Mind\xe2\x80\x93boggling
experiences
tend
to
do
that
to
all
of
us
!
\r\n
'
,
'2
.
We
learn
about
ourselves
by
finding
new
personal
limits
we
might
have
never
thought
were
there
.
And
then
we
break
them
,
and
our
comfort
zone
expands
.
I
never
thought
I
might
be
uncomfortable
to
see
children
near
prostitutes
,
but
it
did
stick
out
in
my
mind.\r\n
'
,
'3
.
After
experiences
like
these
,
we
get
to
see
the
world
with
a
new
,
refined
set
of
eyes
.
And
this
is
excellent
,
because
,
as
Wayne
Dyer
put
it
,
\xe2\x80\x9cwhen
you
change
the
way
you
look
at
things
,
the
things
you
look
at
change\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n
'
,
'4
.
Doing
the
things
we
fear
increases
confidence
,
as
suggested
by
Steven
Aitchison.\r\n
'
,
'A
great
way
to
ground
ourselves
during
these
changes
in
the
way
we
view
life
is
to
meditate
.
At
least
it
helped
me
tremendously.\r\n
'
,
'We
get
to
reinvent
ourselves.\r\n
'
,
'When
I
moved
to
Belgrade
,
which
my
first
city
away
from

<
/object

,
it
felt
like
I
could
finally
get
rid
of
the
expectations
everyone
in
my
environment
had
of
me.\r\n
'
,
'The
biggest
obstacle
to
change
are
often
the
people
closest
to
us
,
as
we
are
afraid
of
disappointing
them
.
It\xe2\x80\x99s
much
easier
not
to
bother
with
what
people
will
think
now
,
but
back
then
it
felt
terrifyingly
uncomfortable
to
do
something
my
parents
or
my
friends
did
not
expect
of
me.\r\n
'
,
'In
a
new
city
,
we
almost
get
to
start
our
lives
over
.
It
makes
replacing
old
habits
with
new
ones
seem
easy
!
In
fact
,
we
have
to
make
new
habits
,
as
everything
is
new
for
us.\r\n
'
,
'The
best
habit
I
picked
up
after
my
move
to
Belgrade
is
to
walk
for
at
least
two
hours
a
day
,
and
I
haven\xe2\x80\x99t
dropped
it
since
.
Walking
allows
me
to
get
to
know
the
city
I
am
in
much
better
,
it\xe2\x80\x99s
a
good
exercise
and
it\xe2\x80\x99s
also
a
form
of
a
meditative
practice.\r\n
'
,
'The
changes
that
happen
within
us
once
we
move
cities
can
be
so
powerful
,
that
I
often
remember
the
past
not
by
year
,
but
by
place
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
lived
in
at
that
moment
in
time
.
It
feels
like
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
led
completely
different
lives
\xe2\x80\x93
I
just
hope
that
I
have
more
lives
than
cats
do
,
because
I\xe2\x80\x99m
close
to
nine

'We
learn
that
people
everywhere

'A
man
that
worked
in
a
guest
house
(
kind
of
like
a
hostel
,
these
are
common
in
Asia
)
I
was
in
during
my
stay
in
Bangkok
came
from
Myanmar
in
search
of
a
better
life.\r\n
'
,
'He
had
12
hour
night
shifts
,
working
six
days
a
week
.
His
work
visa
alone
costs
his
monthly
salary
every
year
.
In
about
eight
years
he\xe2\x80\x99s
worked
at
the
hostel
,
he
got
to
go
home
to
Myanmar
where
he
could
see
his
children
only
twice
.
Lucky
,
now
his
wife
is
also
working
in
Bangkok
,
but
he
told
me
they
only
get
to
see
each
other
for
a
little
bit
every
few
days
,
at
his
workplace.\r\n
'
,
'He
knew
his
situation
was
less
than
ideal
,
but
instead
of
letting
it
all
get
him
down
,
he
spoke
with
great
vigor
of
his
plans
to
open
up
a
business
back
in
Myanmar.\r\n
'
,
'I
realized
we
had
much
more
in
common
than
it
seemed
at
first
glance
.
His
hopes
and
dreams
are
not
much
different
than
mine
,
nor
is
his
struggle
to
materialize
them
.
But
he
had
a
much
more
difficult
starting
position
in
this
life
than
I
did
.
And
to
be
honest
,
I
wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
be
too
keen
to
trade
places
with
him.\r\n

abroad

is
because
by
doing
so
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
learned
that
no

is
much
different
from
us

I\xe2\x80\x99ve
learned
that

living
life
is
ok
and
breeds
just
as
many
happy
and
many
unhappy
people
as
does
life
back

I\xe2\x80\x99ve
expand
my

nothing
beats
that.\r\n

I
zero
in
on
these

can
improve
right
now

for
me

get
overwhelmed
by

so

encouraging

all
over
the

sometimes
,
doing
a
little
bit
here
and
a
little
bit
there

But
since
I
know
concentrated
FOCUS
is
what
can
quickly
transform
little
uneventful
areas
into
inspiring
spaces
,
I
really
have
been

grow
in

to
stick
with
improving
one
corner
at

time
until
it
feels
more

'So
I\
've
been
complaining
about
shortness
of
breath
in
my
last
few
blog
posts
when
walking
or
climbing
stairs
(
more
than
I\
'm
used
to
or
expect
with
40
%
-ish
lung
function
)
.
So
yesterday
morning
when
I
was
out
of
breath
after
just
walking
from

at
work
,
and
after
feeling
sooooo
tired
lately
I
decided
to
go
to
the
Dr
,
even
though
he
can\'t
treat
my
chronic
rejection
any
more
than
it\
's
already
being
treated
and
even
though
I
was
there
just
over
2
weeks
ago.\r\n

,
'\r\n
'
,
``
Had
bloods
done
,
x-ray
,
lung
function
(
was
n't
down
by
as
much
as
I
expected
given
how
crap
I
felt
)
was
38
%
FEV1
%
,
6
min
walk
test
(
O2
sats
were
about
94
%
when
I
started
with
a
heart-rate
of
133
,
which
is
high
,
even
for
me
!
After
6
mins
of
relatively
fast
walking
it
was
83
%
and
HR
159
)
.
Still
felt
like
it
should
have
been
worse
judging
by
how
I
felt.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
Then
the
bloods
showed
elevated
white
cell
count
and
CRP
(
ie
infection
)
and
I
felt
sssoooo
relieved
!
Even
more
relived
when
I
had
a
temp
of
38.7
degrees
C
and
Dr
said
my
chest
sounds
crap
even
though
I
'm
not
coughing
at
all
!
It
means
it
's
actually
something
that
can
be
TREATED
and
not
just
my
lungs
suddenly
deciding
to
decline
way
faster
just
before
our
US
trip
just
to
piss
me
off
!
Must
have
picked
up
something
at
work
(
where
SO
MANY
people
have
been
sick
and
it
sounds
like
a
hospital
waiting
room
with
all
the
sneezing
and
coughing
)
,
but
who
cares
right
?
Corporate
Culture
dictates
that
you
go
to
work
,
not
matter
how
sick
.
Chris
has
also
been
sick
(
thanks
to
someone
at
HIS
work
who
sits
across
from
him
and
came
in
on
Thursday
VERY
sick
)
.
THIS
is
why
some
post
transplant
patients
DO
N'T
work
at
all
,
but
I
wanted
a
normal
life
which
comes
with
this
risk
so
it
's
just
something
I
have
to
deal
with.\r\n

Love
them

We
are
having
lunch
at
my
sister\
's
house
tomorrow
,
looking
forward
to
it
.
My
mom
was
26
when
she
had
me
,
and
29
when
she
had
my
sis
.
Crazy
to
think
that
when
she
was
my
age
,
she
had
to
cope
with
a
2-year
old
and
a
5-year
old
with
a
chronic
disease
(
and
bad
prognosis
at
the
time
)
.
She
is
probably
the
strongest
woman
I
know
,
and
the
best
role-model
a
girl
can
have
.
Growing
up
she
was
the
perfect
mix
if
caring
and
scary
,
and
I
guess
that\
's
what
you
need
to
be
when
raising
a
rebel-ish
child
with
CF
!
And
not
to
mention
absolutely
BEAUTIFUL
,
hopefully
I
have
inherited
her
awesome-ageing
genes
as
well
!

Christmas
was
very
nice
,
better
than
I
expected

Went
to

in
the
morning
with

I
don\'t
go
there
anymore

my

still
do

Haven\'t
been
there
since
Xmas
2005

except
for
a
wedding
and
a
funeral
in
between

was
quite
a
weird

frustrating
for

Last
night
(
or
early
this
morning
to
be
exact
)
a
year
ago
I
was
rushed
to
hospital
in
an
ambulance
at
about
02:30
AM
because
I
was
finding
it
so
hard
to
breathe
.
It
was
the
closest
I
had
ever
come
to
dieing
,
at
least
that
's
how
it
felt
anyway
!
When
they
loaded
me
in
the
ambulance
my
O2
sats
were
36
%
!
The
paramedic
thought
the
machine
was
broken
...
(
if
I
were
able
to
speak
at
that
moment
I
would
've
politely
pointed
out
that
the
machine
was
in
fact
working
,
and
that
I
could
definitely
feel
the
64
%
oxygen
that
was
missing
from
my
body
!
)
Luckily
in
the
end
I
survived
after
some
IV
's
etc
,
just
lost
some
serious
weight.\n

'The
weekend\n
'
,
'My
weekend
was
quiet
,
relaxed
and
a
bit
of
a
blur
...
Feeling
a
lot
better
thankfully
!
Very
gratefull
to
be
coughing
less
and
breathing
easier
.
Energy
still
comes
and
goes
a
bit
,
but
managed
to
get
a
lot
of
rest
in.\n

``
Saw
three
friends
this
weekend
,
each
one
very
unique
.
Seeing
them
got
me
thinking
quite
a
bit
though
.
It
is
interesting
to
observe
the
effect
that
my
whole
situation
has
had
on
my
friendships
...
Actually
,
that
is
an
understatement
.
Some
of
the
reactions
have
upset
me
quite
a
bit
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
'll
be
getting
more
suprises
in
the
future
.
And
I
'll
have
to
learn
how
to
handle
them.\n

'\n
'

'The
worst
is
having
to
go
from
being
close
to
someone
,
to
the
other
person
just
not
really
giving
a
damn
,
getting
too
caught
up
in
their
wildly
exciting
life
to
spare
a
few
moments
to
send
an

,
even
if
they
know
you\
're
\'sick\
'
.
(
they\
're
most
probably
not
reading
this
so
don\'t
start
stressing
thinking
it
may
be
you
!
!
-however
if
you
really
think
it
might
be
you
,
just
ask
me
)
Then
you
get
the
people
who
you
were
always
friends
with
,
but
not
close
friends
,
who\
've
been
great
,
and
shown
care
and
support
all
the
way
,
making
the
friendship
so
much
tighter
.
Next
up
is
the
weird
group
,
although
I
generally
don\'t
deal
with
them
myself
,
it\
's
usually
my
friends
or
mom
who
have
to
face
them
.
They\
're
the
people
who
fake
an
interest
because
it\
's
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
.
They
don\'t
care
how
I\
'm
doing
or
what
exactly\
's
wrong
with
me
,
but
they
ask
anyway
.
And
then
finally
,
there\
's
the
group
who\
's
always
been
your
best
friends
,
who\
're
still
there
for
you
all
the
way
,
and
who
have
to
put
up
with
your
moods
and
frustration
and
anger
caused
by
all
the
groups
of
people
just
listed
.
To
you
guys
I
want
to
say
thank
you
.
If
I
sometimes
act
like
a
bitch
,
it\
's
not
you
I\
'm
angry
with
,
it\
's
the
situation
and
all
the
people
NOT
supporting
me
...
But
rest
assured
...
when
I
get
those
lungs
and
show
my
friends
the
time
of
their
lives
(
you
will
have
to
pay
for
yourself
though
,
I
didn\'t
win
the
lottery
!
)
,
they
won\'t
be
included
!
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
So
to
conclude..
cf
and
especially
transplant
is
the
ultimate
friend-o-meter
(
AND
love-o-meter
,
but
that
's
a
story
for
a
different
day
!
)
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
's
a
good
thing
.
Who
wants
to
waste
time
and
energy
on
fake
friends
?

my

Pseudomonas

SENSITIVE

!

Let
me
explain
for
those
who
don\'t
have

...
Pseudomonas
is
a
very
\'promiscious
bug\
'
(
yes
,
those
are
a
doctor\
's
exact
words
)
,
that
quickly
becomes
resistant
to
any
antibiotics
introduced
.
Lately
the
ONLY
thing
that
my
Pseudo
is
sensitive
to
(
meaning
the
only
drug
that
works
)
is

However
,
by
some

me

,
one

I

but
feeling
the
way
I
do
and
not
wanting

I
told

that
I

to

(
a

TODAY
!
!
!
So
my
mom
and
I
are
off
to
the
ER
at
St
George\
's
this
afternoon
.
I
don\'t
know
what
to
expect
though
,
as
previously
my
doc
and
I
talked
about
getting
a
long-line/PICC
line
the
next
time
I
have
to
go
on
IV\'s..
I\
've
never
had
one
of
those
,
and
it
sounds
scary
,
and
I
can
be
quite
a
wuss
when
it
comes
to
these
type
of
things
!
(
transplant\
's
ideal
for
me
then
!
Haha
!
)
I
will
do
an
update
on
how
it
went..
hope
my
favourite
nurse
,
Jackie
is
there
!

'The
life-changing
thing
...
I
really
can\'t
say
anything
at
the
moment
,
as
it\
's
just
a
thought/idea
.
What
I
can
say
is
that
last
night
when
I
did
some
half-decent
praying
for
the
first
time
in
quite
a
while
,
I
told
God
that
the
two
things
I\
'm
really
scared
of
at
the
moment
is
not
getting
to
JHB
in
time
when
I
get
the
call
for
lungs
(
It\
's
a
1hr
40min
flight
on
a
commercial
airline
,
and
2.5hrs
on
charter
plane
.
I\
've
basically
got
2-4hrs
to
get
there
!
So
it
will
be
tight
!
And
I
can\'t
stay
in
JHB
,
as
the
altitude
makes
it
10
times
harder
for
me
to
breathe
!
I
will
need
very
high
O2
support
.
And
obviously
my
social
and
medical
support
system
is
here
.
)
and
the
other
thing
is
not
getting
lungs
in
time
,
or
having
an
infection
or
something
when
I
do
get
the
call
which
means
they
probably
won\'t
do
it
.
And
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they\
've
only
done
about
3
lung
transplants
this
year
!
Which
scares
me
.
So
this
morning
I
got
a
<
object
value
=
``
phone
''
id
=
``
15
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``

agreement
=
``

''
>
phonecall
<
/object

from
a
family
friend
,
with
the
most
unexpected
story
about
a
man
who
had
2
lung
transplants
who
she
met
via
her
sister
by
coincedence
!
I

''
>
phoned
<
/object

the
guy
and
talked
to
him
and
it
was
SO
INTERESTING
!
It
felt
like
God
might
have
been
answering
my
prayer
right
there
.
Will
keep
you
updated
if
this
should
lead
to
anything
...
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
While
on
the
topic
of
prayer..
One
of
my
new
transplant
friends
(
she
had
hers
in
October
)
and
I
said
last
night
how
much
our
faith
has
helped
us
through
all
of
this
,
and
it
's
so
true
.
And
the
most
amazing
part
is
that
should
the
operation
not
happen
in
time
or
the
new
lungs
are
rejected
,
then
we
've
got
ETERNAL
LIFE
to
look
forward
to
anyway
!
So
it
's
really
a
win-win
situation
for
us
.
Whereas
if
you
do
n't
believe
in
God
you
have
nothing
.
All
you
have
is
luck
,
and
you
have
to
put
all
your
faith
in
people
.
And
while
there
are
brilliant
people
out
there
they
make
mistakes
,
and
in
the
end
they
're
just
like
you
,
with
no
real
power
whatsoever.\n

'I
will
leave
you
now
to
go
and
cough
some
more
and
try
to
get
myself
ready
for
this
afternoon..\n

Yesterday
we
kept
stuff
in
,
so
today
let
's
clear
stuff
out
.
What
is
in
your
diabetic
closet
that
needs
to
be
cleaned
out
?
This
can
be
an
actual
physical
belonging
,
or
it
can
be
something
you
're
mentally
or
emotionally
hanging
on
to
.
Why
are
you
keeping
it
and
why
do
you
need
to
get
rid
of
it
?

'I

over

The
saddest
part
is
that
I
was
trying

now
even
with
the

I
have
ever
had
I
know
my
previous
Endocrinologist
listed
me
as
uncompliant
Even
though
I
worked
really
hard
on
reviewing
my
number
and
making
changes
as
necessary
.
I
know
my
current
family
practice
Dr.
lists
me
as
uncompliant
because
of
the
fact
I
have
complications
and
even
thought
my
<
object
value
=
``

``
1
''
type
=
``

''

is
excellent
.
I
work
very
hard
to
keep
lows
at
bay
and
keep
my
Retinopathy
under
control
in
fact
I
only
see
the
Retina
Specialist
twice
a
year
because
it
is
considered
stable
currently.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
it
infuriates
me
that
they
make
assumptions
the
minute
you
mention
complications
which
to
some
Dr.\
's
means
I
don\'t
try
,
don\'t
test
and
don\'t
care
but
I
find
it
insulting
that
they
write
me
off
.
They
tend
to
not
give
patients
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
.
I
know
that
so
many
people
including
nurses
feel
that
they
are
free
to
comment
negatively
to
the
patient
because
you
have
complications
.
I
wish
they
would
teach
physicians
not
to
use
the
word
uncompliant
with
Diabetic
patients
.
I
know
I
do
request
my
<
object
value

I
do
read

I
have
fired

I
hire
them
for
a
service
not
for
judgement.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
I
wish
more
Dr.\
's
would
understand
that
being
a
Diabetic
is
not
easy
and
getting
perfect
numbers
is
not
possible
.
I
also
wish
they
would
at
least
look
at
my
current

I
know
I
went
to
my
current
eye
Dr.
who
referred
me
to
my
current
Retina
Specialist
.
I
know
I
told
him
my
<
object
value
=
``
A1c
''
id
=
``

''
type
=
``

agreement

been
been
below
7
for
7
years
now

I
happened
that
day
to
have
a
copy
of
my
<
object
value
=
``
A1c
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``
perm
''
agreement
=
``
S
''
>
A1c
<
/object

and
he
seemed
shocked
.
I
know
he
mentioned
most
of
his
patients
A1c
is
not
that
great
but
was
surprised
I
had
Retinopathy
.
I
know
Dr.\
's
are
human
but
I
have
personally
experienced
way
too
much
assuming
and
not
enough
checking
by
Dr.\
's
the
past
couple
of
years
.
I
really
wish
they
would
move
toward
not
using
the
word
uncompliant
because
it
is
really
defeating
statement
to
the
patients
who
really
are
trying.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
I
can\'t
change
much
except
addressing
the
Dr
.
I
currently
see
.
I
have
requested
that
one
Dr.
remove
the
word
uncompliant
from
my
file
because
I
showed
him
my
<
object
value
=
``
A1c

=
``

all
the
Diabetes
data
.
I
don\'t
find
it
fair
that
I
am
automatically
considered
to
be
a
bad
patient
when
I
work
so
hard
.
I
am
trying
to
let
this
go
emotionally
but
I
know
it
will
take
time
to
get
over
the
fact
that
I
can\'t
change
all
Dr.\
's
.
I
am
hoping
that
some
day
they
won\'t
use
that
term
about
any
Diabetic
but
for
now
I
can
only
hope
that
someday
that
is
the
case.\n

you
choose
to
keep

'I

I

I

just

I

another
area
I
won\'t

other
conditions
outside
my

the

that
are

I
like
to

at

time
I
was

Sharing
my
Diabetes
related
information
is
wonderful
in
that
I
can
put
this
stuff
I
am
carrying
around
online
instead
of
on
my

shoulders

\n

'\n
'
,
'I
know
this
past
year
in
January
I
would
not
disclose

I
was

it
was
causing
many
issues
for
me
with

I
feel
that
sharing
exactly
the
issue
was
best
kept
to
myself
because
I
know
I
needed
the
privacy
I
know
I
wished
I
could
share
but
I
know
that
it
really
was
best
left
unsaid
.
I
am
doing
so
much
better
now
with
the
quick
procedure
that
was
done
and
my

I
honestly
had
no
idea
how
much
the
issues
was
causing
issues
with
my
Diabetes
which
does
happen
.
I
am
thankful
I
had
a
wonderful
Dr.
who
my
Endocrinologist
recommended
.
I
know
I
think
we
all
have
some
things
that
are
just
not
appropriate
for
our

.
I
know
I
felt
better
in
the
long
run
not
discussing
it
and
I
know
having
some
privacy
is
really
nice
in
times
like
these.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
I
am
hoping
you
all
understand
the
reasoning
behind
not
sharing
my
procedure
and
my
dating
life
because
I
think
that
information
might
create
issues
.
I
know
if
you
list
a
person
on
your
blog
anyone
can
read
it
and
so
you
also
need
to
think
about
them
.
So
by
leaving
the
off
the

I
can
discuss
them
without
naming
them
but
I
find
it
is
just
better
to
keep
my
that
off
my
<
object
value

and
just
in
my
personal
life

There
will
always
be
parts
of
our
lives
we
won\'t
share

topic
is
I

In

there
was
a
diabetes
blog
theme
of
``

\xe2\x80\x9d
that
participants
found
wonderfully
empowering

So
lets
kick
things
off
this
year
by
looking
at
the
positive
side
of
our
lives
with
diabetes
.
What
have
you
or
your
loved
one
accomplished
,
despite
having
diabetes
,
that
you
weren\'t
sure
you
could
?
Or
what
have
you
done
that
you\

been
particularly
proud
of

Or
what

thing
has
diabetes
brought
into
your
life
?

I
know
I
wake
up
each
day
knowing
that
their
will
always
be
challenges
for
everyone
including
Diabetics

I
really
wish
that
my
father
would
understand
it
's
not
1980
anymore
.
My
father
when
I
wanted
to
run
a
half
marathon
said
it
was
too
dangerous
and
Diabetics
should
not
be
running
half
marathons
but
I
disagree
I
know
plenty
who
have
.
I
am
still
planning
to
run
a
half
marathon
but
after
I
explore
some
other
adventures
I
want
to
go
on
.
I
know
a
big
part

the
reason

father
thinks
this
is
because
I
ca
n't
feel
lows
but
he
also
has
only
seen
the
occasional
low
when
I
visit
at
Christmas
so
he
really
has
not
real
concept
of
what
my
life
is
like
today
.
I
did
have
a
low
that
needed
assistance
but
my
dad
could
have
given
me
a
glucagon
shot
and
been
fine
.
\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
``
I
know
each
year
my
goal
is
always
the
same
to
reduce
my
lows
and
I
get
better
at
doing
so
the
longer
I
have
had
Hypoglycemia
Unawareness
.
I
know
I
will
have
added
precautions
and
planning
even
for
non
exercise
activities
.
I
am
okay
with
that
because
you
get
used
to
those
changes
.
I
know
my
father
about
lost
it
when
I
told
him
next
year
I
am
planning
to
go
to
California
to
get
Accelerated
Free
Fall
training
basically
solo
skydiving
.
I
know
most
people
are
thinking
wow
that
is
dangerous
.
I
know
most
of
the
adrenaline
junkie
activities
I
love
are
dangerous
but
I
am
never
as
happy
as
when
I
am
going
on
my
next
adrenaline
rush
.
I
know
I
also
plan
for
example
zip
lining
,
and
a
couple
new
adventures
as
well
.
I
know
I
wo
n't
let
Diabetes
win.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
``
I
know
I
will
have
critics
who
think
I
am
reckless
or
foolish
but
I
know
me
and
what
I
love
.
Life
is
about
living
the
life
you
want
and
some
times
getting
the
adrenaline
rush
is
exactly
what
I
needed
.
I
know
I
went
sky
diving
back
in
March
and
I
was
in
a
high
for
three
days
afterwards
and
I
never
stopped
smiling
.
I
felt
like
I
had
my
zest
for
life
back
and
I
am
so
know
this
is
what
I
have
been
missing
in
my
life
.
I
know
some
of
my
family
is
like
that
is
awesome
you
love
sky
diving
and
others
are
like
you
ca
n't
do
that
.
I
know
I
can
and
I
will
be
doing
it
.
The
issue
for
me
normally
is
n't
me
doubting
that
I
can
do
it
but
normally
my
family
or
others.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
``
I
do
plan
on
running
a
half
marathon
but
that
has
been
put
on
hold
while
I
pursue
skydiving
for
a
while
.
I
do
plan
on
pushing
myself
to
achieve
my
goals
and
dreams
.
I
have
been
told
no
so
many
times
in
my
life
but
I
have
always
been
able
to
accomplish
these
goals
.
I
know
when
my
Endocrinologist
tells
me
that
I
can
go
skydiving
I
should
be
fine
.
I
know
I
told
her
my
plan
I
have
for
skydiving
and
she
looked
at
my
graph
for
the
day
and
she
said
I
looked
great
.
I
also
get
better
at
planning
these
activities
.
Also
a
word
of
advice
do
n't
have
the
Dr.
notate
in
your
file
you
are
sky
diving
if
you
injure
yourself
the
insurance
wo
n't
cover
it
.
\n
''

'\n

'I
am
so
over
joyed
that
I
am
going
to
do
skydiving
because
I
can
and
honestly
I
deserve
to
be
happy
like
any
other
person
does
.
I
am
tired
of
my
father
trying
to
trap
me
into
the
thought
process
of
the
time
I
was
diagnosed
where
they
limited
everything
in
life
.
I
know
with
all
these
incredible
Diabetic
athletes
why
could
I
not
.
I
know
my
body
has
always
given
me
so
many
challenges
but
I
do
not
give
up
easily
and
I
will
continue
to
search
for
my
next
crazy
fun
activity
because
life
is
so
much
better
when
I
do.\n

'When
Juggling
Several
Conditions
at
Once\n
'
,
'I
know
at
time
it
is
so
easy
forget
I
even
have
Rheumatoid
Arthritis
since
I
was
19
.
I
know
most
of
the
time
it
is
just
in
the
background
and
I
don\'t
have
to
do
much
.
I
know
since
my
last
flare
up
I
have
never
really
got
back
to
where
I
was
previously
.
I
know
I
have
noticed
changes
in
my
hands
and
my
ability
to
open
the
plastic
bags
in
the
produce
section
is
almost
always
too
much
for
me
to
handle
.
I
know
I
am
thrilled
with
my
current
<

``

type

``

<
/object
>
but
it
seems
to
work
okay
but
I
am
worried
about
the
long
term
changes
with
my
hands
.
I
know
recently
I
have
noticed
that
in
the
mornings
when
I
am
at
my
stiff
I
have
trouble
opening
doors
now
and
I
have
noticed
it
can
at
times
be
painful
to
be
typing
on
the
<
object
value
=
``

in
the
mornings
until
I
have
gotten
my
joints
loosened
up
.
I
know
I
want
<
object
value

``

id

``

to
help
at
times
by
pressing
the
button
on
the
door
but
they
are
so
stiff
she
can\'t
.
So
I
am
stuck
having
to
hit
the
button
which
hurts
.
So
I
know
I
need
to
discuss
this
with
my
Dr.
next
week.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
she
has
always
considered
my
RA
to
be
mild
and
not
even
moderate
but
with
the
recent
changes
I
am
not
sure
what
to
think
.
I
know
I
work
out
frequently
but
normally
I
seem
to
handle
it
pretty
well
.
I
do
know
that
the
recent
changes
make
me
really
nervous
that
I
won\'t
get
back
to
the
way
things
used
to
be
.
I
know
my
<
object
value
=
``
medication
''
id
=
``
4
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
SEM
''
>
current
medication
Methotrexate
<
/object
>
worked
really
well
at
first
but
not
so
much
now
.
I
know
it
is
supposed
to
help
stop
the
progression
of
my
RA
but
I
feel
like
that
is
not
the
case
currently
.
Another
issue
I
have
found
is
that
normally
with
<
object
value
=
``
medication
''
id
=
``
4
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
SEM
''
>

can\'t
use

.
Sadly
my
<
object
value
=
``

monitor
''
id
=
``
3
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``

''
>

<
/object

will
not
tolerate
the
use
of
acetaminophen
.
So
basically
if
I
hurt
myself
I
can\'t
use
any
pain
relief
medications.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
I
tend
to
be
clumsy
at
times
and
I
have
had
to
just
grin
and
bear
it
but
at
other
times
I
take
the
risk
and
take
the
<

value

``

=
``

type
=
``

status
=
``

''
agreement
=
``

''
>

<

I
know
this
is
not
recommended
because
it
reduces
the
effectiveness
of
the
<
object
value

=
``
perm
''
status

``

=
``

<

.
So
I
have
only
done
it
once
or
twice
.
So
now
I
am
questioning
in
general
what
I
can
do
.
I
am
hoping
my
Dr.
will
help
me
find
a
solution
but
I
am
feeling
more
and
more
like
this

=
``

agreement
=
``

.
I
know
I
am
willing
to
try
new
medications
with
the
hopes
they
last
right
up
to
when
I
can
take
my
next
dose
.
I
know
most
of
the
time
I
feel

and
I
can\'t

night
so
technically
I
might
just
need
a
higher
dosage
but
trying
to
juggle
my
needs

need
to

I

at

worry
way
too

Rheumatoid
Arthritis

and
Celiac

I

tend
to
show
up
in
ways

am
not
always
expecting
but
hopefully
I
can
find
some
relief
soon.\n

,
'I
love
the
concept
of
the
Dexcom
and
what
it
can
do
for
most
people

I
know
I
am
the

in
that

I
start
working
out
and
I
expect
to
see
my
blood
sugars
rise
during
the
beginning
of
my
work
out
since
I
do
not
bolus
for
my
meal
before
going
to
the

So
I
start
working
out
and
I
am
20
minutest
into
my
workout
and
I
look
at
my
<
object
value
=
``

id
=
``

type
=
``
perm
''
status

``

agreement

``

and
it
has
one
pointed
straight
up
but
I
was
expecting
to
see
my
<
object
value
=
``

monitor
''
id
=
``

type
=
``

showing
that
it
was
leveling
off
and
will
be
showing
a
drop
.
So
I
continued
working
out
another
five
minutes
.
Then
<
object
value

``
dog

id

``
4

``

agreement

runs
over
to
my
machine
and
stares
at
me
.
I
know
the
look
when
I
need
to
check
.
So
I
finish
the
last
two
minutes
and
then
test
.
Sure
enough
I
was
actually
69
and
the
<
object
value
=
``

monitor
''
id
=
``
3
''
type
=
``

''
status

``

still
had

moving

was
actually
low.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
during
these
times
having
<

A
great
deal
of
the
time
my

``

type

``

will
say
it
is
moving
up
quickly
when
it
is
not
most
of
the
time

So
I
always
test
to
see
where
I
actually
am
.
I
know
even
when
I
have
had
bad
lows
where
I
needed
assistance
normally
40
minutes
after
the
event
the
<

finally
catches
up
.
I
am
not
sure
why
there
is
such
a
delay
but
I
also
know
that
Medtronic\
's
CGM
is
even
worse
for
me
.
So
I
do
the
best
I
can
with
the
information
I
have
.
I
have
recently
moved
my
CGM
blood
sugar
down
when
I
start
working
out
.
By
starting
my
blood
sugar
levels
at
a
lower
than
my
actual
number
has
helped
improve
the
accuracy
of
the
alerts
some
what
I
am
seeing
it
alert
ten
minutes
after
my
low
instead
of
40
minutes
.
I
have
not
run
into
any
issues
with
doing
so
.
I
was
worried
about
highs
but
that
has
not
been
an
issue
so
far.\n

and
I
am
unable

I
know
each
morning
I
have
noticed
that
I
have
had
increasing
difficulty
with
my
hands
and
being
able
to
get
my
body
to
function
like
normal
.
So
I
know
my
up
coming
appointment
with
my
Rheumatologist
I
know
I
have
some
issue
to
discuss.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
am
not
really
sure
what
the
Dr.
is
going
to
recommend
but
after
a
year
of

Methotrexate

I
am
not
feeling
like
it
is
for
me
.
I
am
hoping
she
is
willing
to
help
me
find
a
drug
that
will
not
have
as
many
restrictions
like
Methotrexate
does
such
as
I
have
to
limit
sun
exposure
which
is
difficult
when
living
in
Texas
.
I
also
need
to
avoid
people
who
are
sick
because
it
does
suppress
the
immune
system
.
Then
I
am
not
able
to
even
enjoy
the
occasional
drink
with
friends
because
it
can
elevate
the
levels
of
your
liver
which
is
not
good
.
So
I
know
I
am
not
really
happy
at
this
point
and
I
am
hoping
they
have
other
options
available
but
I
also
know
my
insurance
only
covers
one
or
two
RA
medications
currently
the
rest
are
not
covered
.
So
my
choices
are
limited
which
does
not
help
.
All
I
know
is
that
today
at
work
I
have
needed
to
get
up
more
because
my
<
object
value
=
``

does
seem
effective
enough
.
Hoping
I
can
get
some
results
I
need
soon.\n

'My
Retinopathy
Experience\n
'
,
'I
know
I
have
been
thinking
back
to
my
Retinopathy
Diagnosis
several
years
ago
.
I
know
I
started
my
<
object
value
=
``
blog
''
id

``

''
type
=
``

around
the
time
my
Retinopathy
showed
up
in
my
life
.
I
remember
I
woke
up
one
morning
and
noticed
black
spots
in
my
vision
which
were
small
hemorrhages
in
my
eye
.
I
went
to
the
eye
Dr.
that
day
because
I
was
concerned
.
He
took
one
look
and
said
that
I
had
a
Retina
Detachment
.
So
I
was
told
with
my
eyes
dilated
I
needed
to
go
to
the
Retina
Specialist
now
.
So
I
left
the
office
very
scared
.
I
know
they
rushed
me
back
immediately
when
I
arrived
at
the
Retina
Specialist
office
.
The
nurse
comes
in
and
starts
to
ask
me
questions
.
I
know
she
said
they
believe
I
have
Retinopathy
and
I
knew
that
was
most
likely
the
case
.
The
nurse
then
says
to
me
I
guess
you
should
have
taken
better
care
of
yourself
.
I
told
the
nurse
that
was
not
the
case
and
I
did
not
deserve
to
be
treated
this
way
.
I
told
her
to
leave
her
judgement
at
the
door.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
Next
thing
the
Dr.
comes
in
and
looks
at
my
eye
.
He
says
the
good
news
is
that
I
do
n't
have
a
Retina
Detachment
but
I
do
have
Retinopathy
.
I
also
had
quite
a
few
new
blood
vessels
which
are
leaking
and
hemorrhaging
.
So
they
say
I
need
to
be
treated
immediately
.
The
Dr.
says
to
help
stop
of
the
bleeding
I
need
to
have
an
injection
into
my
eye
.
I
know
when
he
said
that
I
was
shocked
that
was
what
they
were
going
to
do
.
I
have
always
had
a
thing
about
anything
being
close
to
my
eye
so
it
was
difficult
.
I
hated
the
injections
they
were
not
painful
but
they
worked
really
well
.
Then
I
was
told
I
needed
to
come
back
for
more
procedures
which
they
used
dyes
which
could
show
the
blood
flow
in
the
eyes
called
an
angiogram
.
They
also
did
regular
pictures
and
other
exams
.
I
know
it
was
an
overwhelming
experience
and
I
know
I
was
extremely
scared
at
the
time
.
I
decided
that
I
would
take
things
one
day
at
a
time
.
I
also
knew
that
I
wanted
to
make
sure
my
A1c
was
under
6.5
to
prevent
any
further
complications
and
I
actually
had
been
in
that
range
for
several
years
so
I
just
needed
to
make
sure
I
stayed
in
range.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
they
then
said
I
needed
laser
procedures
done
which
I
was
okay
with
.
I
had
no
idea
that
it
could
be
as
painful
as
it
was
.
I
also
had
no
idea
that
my
Retina
specialist
at
the
time
was
not
following
the
standard
procedure
for
doing
laser
procedures
.
He
had
me
laying
back
in
a
chair
trying
to
laser
my
eye
but
that
did
not
work
because
my
eye
was
watering
the
whole
time
.
Normally
you
are
in
an
up
right
position
sitting
as
the
Dr.
does
the
laser
procedure
.
I
know
my
Dr.
then
told
me
I
needed
to
have
a
Vitrecotomy
since
the
laser
was
not
working
.
I
know
that
seemed
wrong
he
only
tried
twice
to
laser
my
eyes
.
So
I
went
to
get
a
second
opinion
.
I
meet
another
young
woman
who
had
Retinopathy
and
she
spent
time
talking
with
me
.
I
found
out
that
if
you
do
have
a
Vitrectomy
you
could
also
need
further
surgeries
and
she
had
several
.
She
told
me
to
try
and
see
if
the
laser
procedures
worked
first
and
not
to
jump
into
surgery.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'So
I
took
her
advice
.
I
changed
Retina
Specialist
and
he
did
laser
procedures
and
a
year
and
half
later
I
have
had
not
procedures
done
and
no
bleeding
.
So
I
know
the
surgery
seems
like
a
good
idea
but
for
me
I
knew
I
just
wanted
to
avoid
the
surgery
if
at
all
possible
.
So
for
me
it
worked
.
I
know
my
experience
is
not
typical
but
we
need
to
all
communicate
what
we
need
.
For
me
avoiding
surgery
has
been
a
blessing
and
I
today
still
have
20/20
vision
and
no
new
blood
vessel
growth
in
my
eyes
.
I
do
work
everyday
to
keep
my
eyes
healthy
by

'
,
'\n
'
,
``
I
know
this
journey
was
scary
and
I
encourage
everyone
to
share
because
I
know
I
did
not
find
any
one
sharing
their
experiences
several
years
ago
.
It
can
be
incredibly
scary
but
I
know
for
me
I
found
taking
it
one
day
at
a
time
made
it
all
manageable
.
I
also
did
a
great
deal
of
research
which
helped
me
have
realistic
expectations
.
I
know
I
felt
better
knowing
about
procedures
before
they
were
done
.
So
I
made
it
a
point
to
read
up
and
educate
myself
.
I
know
I
do
n't
know
what
I
would
have
done
without
my
friend
online
who
shared
her
experience
.
I
know
I
made
the
decisions
I
needed
to
make
for
me
.
I
know
I
learned
I
need
to
advocate
for
myself
as
well
.
I
know
some
of
the
best
advice
my
Dr.
gave
me
is
to
sleep
on
two
pillows
to
help
keep
blood
from
flowing
into
your
field
of
vision
when
sleeping
.
Most
hemorrhages
happen
when
you
are
asleep
.
My
first
Retina
Specialist
did
not
share
this
advice
so
I
felt
he
just
was
their
for
the
money
always
wanting
me
to
go
for
a
surgery
.
I
know
I
have
never
been
happier
to
fire
a
Dr.
than
that
one.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
today
my
eyes
are
doing
great
and
I
hope
to
see
them
continue
to
be
in
good
condition
.
I
know
I
have
learned
so
much
from
my
experience
.
I
also
did
not
realize
how
strong
I
was
until
I
walked
this
road
alone
.
I
know
I
hope
everyone
continues
to
share
their
experiences
because
it
means
the
world
to
someone
who
is
going
through
it
completely
scared
.
I
know
that
my
combination
of
therapies
of
injections
,
laser
and
keeping
A1c
down
have
all
helped
me
to
get
my
Retinopathy
stable
and
stay
stable
the
past
several
years.\n

'35
Years
Where
Did
The
Time
Go\n
'
,
``
I
know
last
year
I
really
was
struggling
with
my
Diaversary
but
this
year
is
so
much
different
.
I
know
my
goal
this
year
was
to
make
my
Diaversary
a
little
more
fun
.
I
know
growing
up
we
never
celebrated
me
making
it
another
year
or
did
anything
on
the
date
.
In
fact
I
do
n't
know
the
exact
date
of
my
diagnosis
.
My
mother
would
have
possible
know
the
date
but
she
passed
away
seven
years
ago
.
So
I
have
not
idea
except
that
my
mother
told
me
I
was
diagnosed
when
I
was
18
months
old
at
all
my
Dr.
appointments
.
I
was
diagnosed
back
in
1980
boy
does
this
make
me
feel
old
but
back
to
the
subject
at
hand
.
So
this
I
woke
up
that
day
feeling
completely
in
awe
that
I
have
Type
1
Diabetes
and
that
no
matter
what
has
happened
even
with
dealing
with
complications
I
feel
like
I
have
accomplished
a
great
deal
.
I
know
I
am
so
happy
that
my
Retinopathy
has
been
stable
that
my
vision
is
still
20/20
even
with
my
Retinopathy
.
I
am
also
proud
that
I
found
solutions
for
all
the
issues
my
Diabetes
has
thrown
at
me.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
I
have
done
the
best
I
can
over
the
years
and
I
am
proud
that
even
with
my
Hypoglycemia
Unawareness
that
it
has
not
stopped
me
.
I
still
jump
out
of
planes
,
run
and
exercise
like
everyone
else
.
The
only
thing
that
has
changed
is
that
I
have
to
pre-plan
everything
out
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
really
a
small
change
.
I
know
I
have
had
to
learn
so
much
from
my
Hypoglycemia
Unawareness
it
has
taught
me
to
appreciate
things
even
more
.
It
has
taught
me
to
really
pay
more
attention
to
what
foods
and
I
am
eating
and
how
it
affects
my
blood
sugar
.
I
know
through
it
all
I
am
still
shocked
it
has
been
35
years
.
I
know
I
am
proud
and
I
know
my
mother
would
have
been
proud
as
well.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
know
my
life
with
Type
1
Diabetes
has
never
been
easy
and
will
continue
to
be
full
of
challenges
.
i
know
my
Diabetes
has
taught
me
to
be
incredibly
resourceful
and
creative
in
finding
solutions
.
I
know
I
also
owe
my
parents
a
great
deal
gratitude
for
doing
an
exceptional
job
of
managing
my
Type
1
Diabetes
.
They
were
incredible
in
their
dedication
.
I
also
admire
how
they
found
ways
to
make
the
worst
part
of
Diabetes
more
fun
when
ever
possible
.
I
am
sitting
here
today
in
awe
of
it
all
.
I
also
I
am
thankful
that
I
continue
to
work
at
my
Diabetes
.
I
know
I
would
not
be
the
same
person
today
without
my
Diabetes
and
I
am
celebrating
that
today
.
I
am
also
celebrating
I

Bailey
started
making
big
barks
at

I
made

``
So
about
oneteen
days
ago
,
I
did
a
bad
thing
.
It
was
a
BIG
Bad
Thing
.
I
peed
on
Mommy

.
On

,
'\n
'
,
'Uh
oh.\n

,
'\n
'
,
'But
guess
what
?
Mommy
didn\'t
get
mad
.
Instead
she
said
,
``
Bandit
,
that
is
not

you
to
do
a
naughty
thing
like
that

What
is
wrong

\n

'\n
'
,
'I
just
looked
at
her

What
are
you
talking
about
Mommy
?
The
Ghost
Puppy
did
that.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'The
next
day
,
Mommy
called
Dr.
Hawkins
and
said
,
``
Bandit
is
acting
squirrelier
than
normal
and
last
night
he
peed
on
my
pillow
.
Can
you
make
sure
he
is
not
sick
?
''
She
also
tattled
on
me
and
told
the
doctor
that
I
broke
my

and
went
to
visit
my
pal
Nico
and
I
snarled
at
him
when
he
sniffed
my
butt
.
Mommy
can\'t
keep
any
secrets.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'So
I
had
to
go
see
Dr.
Hawkins
and
she
ran
experiments
on
my
potty
and
felt
my
whole
body
all
over
and
then
used
big
needles
and
sucked
out
some
blood
.
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'You
should
know
that
I
have
had
my
blood
sucked
out
before
,
when
I
ate
that
cat
toy
and
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
.
(
Remember
?
That
is
when
I
met
Santa
!
)
They
did
experiments
on
my
blood
and
I
got
my
superpower
(
talking
to
Mommy
in
my
head
)
.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Mostly
I
am
pretty
good
when
they
want
to
suck
out
my
blood
and
run
experiments
.
But
this
time
I
did
NOT
like
it
when
they
poked
me
with
needles
.
So
I
growled
and
snapped
.
But
they
kept
poking
.
So
I
made
a
big
stink
bomb
with
my
butt
to
tell
everyone
to
GO
AWAY
AND
STOP
POKING
ME
.
My
butt
bomb
stunk
up
the
whole
vet
office
.
But
guess
what
?
They
stopped
poking
me
!
HAHA
on
them

'\n

'Dr

Hawkins
said
my
pee
might
maybe
have
an
infection

that
is
why
I
peed
someplace
I

And
Dr.
Hawkins
said
my

leg
and
hips
were
a
little
stiff

ouchy

that
might
be
why
I
have
been

'Holding
Both\r\n
'
,
``
Lately
I
've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
how
this
maintenance
journey
is
about
holding
seemingly
opposing
concepts
.
The
first
concept
goes
like
this
...
\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
'It
is
not
ok
to
overeat
.
It
is
not
ok
to
mindlessly
eat
a
bunch
of
junk
.
It
is
not
ok
to
engage
in
bingy
behaviors
that
leave
me
feeling
regretful
and
yucky
.
It
is
not
ok
to
skip
my
workouts
.
It
is
not
ok
to
eat
in
a
non-goal-oriented
way.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'And
the
second
concept
is
...
\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
When
it
happens
,
it
's
ok.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
This
is
a
contradiction
and
our
brains
do
n't
really
like
that
.
But
it
's
a
dissonance
we
have
to
get
used
to
,
we
have
to
teach
our
brains
to
hold
both
,
because
both
are
true.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
How
do
I
do
that
?
Part
of
it
is
about
staying
in
the
moment
.
When
I
was
in
my
mid-20
's
I
read
Wherever
You
Go
,
There
You
Are
by
Jon
Kabat-Zinn
.
That
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
concept
of
mindfulness
.
Mindfulness
is
about
being
in
the
present
moment
.
If
we
stay
in
the
present
moment
,
we
can
really
only
hold
one
of
the
above
concepts
at
a
time.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
In
this
moment
,
these
choices
are
not
ok
,
and
I
will
not
accept
them
.
In
this
moment
,
I
will
hold
that
eating
a
ton
of
chocolate
at
the
staff
meeting
,
just
because
someone
brought
it
,
is
not
permitted
.
By
who
's
authority
is
it
not
permitted
?
By
my
own
,
of
course
.
I
am
the
only
one
in
charge
here.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
But
an
hour
later
,
when
my
authority
was
compromised
,
by
me
,
I
must
hold
something
different
.
It
happened
,
it
's
ok
.
In
this
moment
,
it
is
ok.
Because
if
it
's
not
,
I
have
to
scold
,
point
fingers
and
otherwise
assign
blame
.
Blame
can
lead
to
shame
.
Shame
leads
to
weakness
,
hiding
,
fear
.
None
of
those
feelings
will
help
me
make
the
next
right
decision.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
'So
it\
's
ok
in
this
moment
.
And
then
not
.
Hmph
,
I
started
out
by
saying
we
have
to
hold
both
but
I
guess
what
I\
've
described
,
by
bringing
in
this
mindfulness
idea
,
is
that
we
only
have
to
hold
one
.
At
a
time
.
No
dissonance
,
no
conflict
.
The
question
becomes
,
``
what
is
true
in
this
moment
?
''
What
do
I
need
right
now
to
move
toward
my
goals
.
Whatever
I
need
,
hold
that
.
Forget
the
other
.
The
other
is
not
here
,
in
this
moment
.
The
other
can
be
used
in
some
other
moment
when
it
is
needed.\r\n

'All
that
said
,
my
weight
is
staying
within
range

I
was
144
pounds
last
Wednesday
.
That
was
a
4+
pound
drop
from
the
week
prior
,
which
is
crazy
.
I
expect
it
will
bounce
back
up
by
a
couple
pounds
this
week

Ok
,
enough
about
all
that
...
I
have
a
tummy
tuck
update

After
healing
from
the
surgery
I
noticed
my
skin
was
a
little
funny
where
the
incision
ended
,
near
my
hips
,
kind
of
crinkled
up
.
Apparently
this
happens
a
lot
so
the
doctor
said
he
could
fix
it
when
I
'm
ready
.
Also
,
I
'd
paid
extra
to
have
my
love
handles
removed
but
they
are
still
there
,
so
he
's
fixing
that
too
.
I
'm
scheduled
to
go
in
for
what
I
'm
calling
a
touch-up
,
in
July
,
going
under
the
knife
again
,
hopefully
for
the
last
time
.
I
'm
sure
I
'll
post
pictures
after
all
is
said
and
done.\r\n

Everything

The

doing
great

Miguel
and
I
are
humming
along
with
our
new

all
working
together

And
I
'm
enjoying
the

I
might
sign
up
for
a

just
to
give
me
some

even
if
I

up

In

for
the
next
three
days
in
a

I
remembered
working
out
pretty
hard

I
felt
really
strong
and
good

was

'Anyway
,
the
pain
grew
to
the
point
at

I
had
to
stop
exercising
altogether
for
a
couple
weeks

Eventually
I
was
able
to
get
back

my

is

TLC

'On
the
food
front
,
things
continue
to
go
pretty
well

I\
'm
still
attending
WW
meetings
every
week
for
a
reminder
,
for
inspiration
and
motivation
.
I
haven\'t
been
tracking
lately
,
my
weight
is
back
in
my
official
WW
``
goal
''
window
(
145-149
)
but
just
barely
.
All
in
all
,
I\
'm
quite
happy
with
how
things
are
going
in
this
department
.
It
feels
as
though
I\
'm
starting
to
get
a
more
intuitive
relationship
with
food
,
the
foundation
of
that
being
I
have
a
radical
knowledge
that
I
can
eat
whatever
I
want
,
and
however
much
I
want
.
All
the
choices
are
mine
and
mine
alone.\r\n

'Enough
on
that

the
final
thing
happening
is
,
I
have
a
cold

At
least
it\
's
coinciding
with
this
back
pain
thing
so
I\
'm
not
getting
sidelined
by
it
.
My
hope
is
that
about
the
time
the
cold
goes
away
,
maybe
my
back
will
be
ready
for
more
regular
exercise.\r\n

Some
days
are
better
than
others
.
Today
was
an
other
.
Funny
thing
though
,
the
last
few
times
I
've
had
monster-bad
days
,
I
have
n't
wanted
to
eat
.
In
the
way-back
past
I
would
've
wanted
a
bag
of
chips
and
a
pint
of
ice
cream
-
for
an
appetizer
.
But
now
,
it
's
as
if
I
ca
n't
really
enjoy
food
when
I
'm
feeling
like
crap
.
At
least
in
the
initial
jolt
of
pain
or
sadness
.
Unfortunately
,
it
does
n't
really
last
.
Give
it
a
day
or
two
and
I
'll
probably
want
to
dive
head-first
into
that
ice
cream.\r\n

'Aside

the
state

going

Last

the
week
following
the

I
hit

on
Monday
and
did
a
light
,
post-half
recovery
workout
.
Tuesday
I
was
hit
with
a
wave
of
exhaustion
in
the
late
afternoon
and
thought
it
smart
to
get
some
rest
.
I
did
just
run
13.1
miles
on
Sunday
after
all.\r\n

'Jumping
back
to
Wednesday
,
I
lost
2.2
pounds
this
past
week
.
It
was
no
surprise
given
I\
'd
gained
3.2
pounds
the
week
prior
.
Something
crazy
is
happening
with
my
weight
,
jumping
around
like
that
.
I\
'm
curious
to
see
what
it
will
be
this
week
.
So
I\
'm
149.8
,
which
is
.8
pounds
over
what
I\
'm
allowed
to
be
to
maintain
free
Lifetime
status
at
WW
(
my
official
goal
weight
is
147
and
we\
're
allowed
to
be
+/-
2
pounds
of
that
weight

'But
I\
'm
definitely
not
starving
myself
to
get
there

Friday
evening
I
had
dinner
in
a
restaurant
.
I
had
a
few
sips
of
wine
,
a
bit
of
bread
,
shared
fried
calamari
for
an
appetizer
(
I
know
,
I
know
,
but
it
was
so
good
)
and
ordered
grilled
salmon
for
the
entree
.
The
salmon
came
with
steamed
veggies
and
the
smallest
portion
of
roasted
red
potatoes
I\
'd
ever
seen
.
And
a
small
cannoli
for
dessert

I
entered

everything

Not

bad.\r\n

'We
had
a
family
Easter
party
on
Saturday
(
the
only
day
that
worked
for
everyone

but
I
made
smart
choices
there
(
including
no
candy
)
,
knowing
I
was
attending
a
dinner
party
that
evening
.
The
dinner
party
was
over
the

with
one
of
the
guests
being
a
bona

chef
who
prepared
the
food

He
served
everything
small-plate
style
and
we
all
stood
around
the
island
eating
and
drinking
while
plate
after
plate
of
yummy
stuff
emerged
.
Oh.my.calories
was
there
a

it

I
comforted
myself
by
mentally
increasing
the
mileage
in
my
planned
Sunday
run
by
1
mile
with
every
passing
hour
.
Points-wise
I
decided
to
just
wipe
out
all
the
Weekly
Points
I
had
left
plus
any
unused
Activity
Points
(
including
those
I
'd
earn
on
Sunday
's
run
)

Who
knows
if
this
is
right

it
's
too
much
to
attempt
calculating

'Sunday
came
around
and
it
was
time
to
pay
the
piper
get
outdoors
and
experience
the
joy
of
physical
exertion
.
A
trail
run
was
just
what
I
needed
to
clear
both
my
head
and
my
body
.
I
did
a
loop
route
in
the
Henry
Coe
State
Park
,
a
trail
I
hiked
for
the
first
time
about
a
year
ago.\r\n

'The
loop
is
6
miles

Some
parts
were
either
too
steep
up/downhill
to
run
-
up
being
too
hard
,
down
being
too
scary
-
or
the
trail
was
too
rocky/narrow
.
So
where
I
could
run
,
I
ran
,
otherwise
I
hiked
,
quickly
,
to
keep
the
exertion
at
workout
levels
(
vs

stroll
level

out

after

I
was
a
little
stiff
from
the
trail
run
but
mentally
,
I
really
needed
a
workout
.
I
started
with

2.34
miles
in

the
size
of
the

I
ran
over

that\
's

it\

Then

went

I
had
to
cut
short
the
number

my

were
just
not
up
to
it

and
after

I
just
stopped
altogether

My

was
n't
happy

I
was

it

Aside
from
my
being

enough

fuel
what
I
was

do
either.\r\n

I\xe2\x80\x99ve

I

'In

dealing
with

a

full
of
disappointing

and

begrudging

to

But

'We
picked
ourselves
up
from
the
day

terrible
,
disappointing
showings
and
kept
checking
every
single
listing
that
popped
on
the
market
...
within
MINUTES
of
it
coming
on
the
market
.
I
mean
it
when
I
say
this
is
a
part-time
job
.
It
has
been
detrimental
to
be
one
of
the
first
showings

a
good
house.\n
'
,
'A
house
came
up
on
the
market
on
Tuesday
afternoon

Tom

I

it
over

got
pretty
obsessed

I
also

,
``
She
got
us
a
showing
the
following
day
(
Wednesday
)
and
it
was
exactly
as
we
'd
hoped
.
Perfection
.
However
,
we
knew
others
had
SOMEHOW
seen
it
before
us
.
So
we
put
in
a
really
strong
offer
before
the
day
was
out
,
to
which
they
had
24
hours
to
accept
or
deny.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
Thursday
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
WAITED
.
Somewhere
after
24
hours
had
passed
,
we
FINALLY
got
word
that
they
had
received
multiple
offers
and
they
wanted
everyone
's
highest
and
best
by
Friday
at
5pm
.
We
decided
our
first
offer
was
truly
the
strongest
we
could
do
,
so
we
left
it
the
same
,
not
knowing
how
many
others
we
were
against
.
People
,
we
offered
their
list
price
,
and
we
assumed
others
went
over
.
This
is
actually
really
common
in
the
market
here
and
in
other
cities.\n
''
,
'Thinking
they
would
get
the
offers
and
choose
the
highest
one
,
we
expected
to
hear
something
before
the
end
of
the
day
or
in
the
morning
on
Saturday
.
Nada
.
Fearing
we
would
lose
this
beautiful
house
,
I
wrote
the
owners
a
heartfelt
letter
praising
them
for
taking
such
immaculate
care
of
their
home
and
property
.
I
complimented
them
and
then
explained
that
we
were
looking
for
our
first
home
and
yada
yada
yada
.
Guys
,
I
went
ULTRA
cheesy
and
talked
about
our
future
children
and
how
I
really
want
to
raise
them
in
this
home
.
I
put
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
,
but
admitted
that
I
understood
it
has
to
come
down
to
their
best
financial
choice
.
I
had
my
Realtor
pass
on
the
letter
and
let
it
be
.

Another

would
have
netted

more

we
have
a

closing
date
(

I
wrote
the

we
won

We

'\n

,
``
So
now
the
clock
starts
ticking
.
Our
due
diligence
starts
tomorrow
.
This
means
we
have
to
officially
put
down
our
earnest
money
,
meet
with
our
loan
officer
and
see
what
they
can
officially
work
out
for
a
loan
,
and
get
an
appraisal
and
home
inspection
done
(
which
,
for
the
sake
of
transparency
adds
up
to
1K
or
more
that
the
buyer
pays
out
of
pocket
...
and
if
you
end
up
deciding
the
property
needs
too
much
work
,
wo
n't
appraise
near
enough
to
your
offer
and
the
sellers
wo
n't
negotiate
down
,
you
just
lose
that
money
and
never
see
it
again
...
just
FYI
)
.
Once
you
find
out
its
actual
worth
or
any
issues
it
has
,
you
negotiate
that
the
seller
needs
to
fix
this
or
that
,
or
they
need
to
bring
down
the
price
to
come
closer
to
appraisal
.
All
this
happens
in
only
TWO
weeks
or
less.\n

'This
is
all

but
anything
could
happen
and
we
or
they
could
choose
to
back
out
.
If
we
end
up
needing
to
renegotiate
and
one
side
or
another
doesn\'t
budge
,
that
could
cause
this
train
to
leave
the

Hopefully
that
doesn\'t
happen

we
need
to
keep
it
in

to
do

Breathe
perhaps

'HALF
A
YEAR
WITH
HALF
A
LEG\n
'
,
'
Six
months
ago
,
at
this
exact
moment
,
I
was
hyperventilating
in
my
hospital
room
and
trying
to
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
I
was
about
to
have
part
of
my
leg
removed
.
Woah
.
In
some
ways
it
feels
like
I
just
had
my
surgery
a
few
weeks
ago
,
but
in
other
ways
,
it
feels
like
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
been
an
amputee
my
whole
life.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'The
past
six
months
have
been
nothing
short
of
incredible
.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
grown
,
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
changed
,
and
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
become
stronger
.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
been
constantly
reminded
of
just
how
great
the
little
things
in
life
are
.
As
a
result
of
the
event
that
occurred
on
November
25
,
2014
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
had
some
amazing
experiences
,
including
speaking
at
schools
and
retreats
,
being
part
of
a
council
at
the
hospital
,
and
participating
in
a
commercial
.
I
finished
my
first
post-amp
5K
,
dipped
my
toes
in
the
ocean
for
the
first
time
in
years
,
and
learned
how
to

'
,
'\n
'
,
'I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
lying
if
I
said
that
the
past
six
months
have
been
perfect
or
without
challenges
.
It
certainly
has
not
been
easy
.
My
patience
has
been
tested
as
I
have
had
to
wait
for
things
:
a
<
object
value

``

id
=
``

''
type
=
``

''

``

agreement

``

''

,
the
ability
to

``

''
>
drive
<

,
and
the
freedom
to
walk
unassisted
,
to
name
a
few
.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
worked
through
post-op
pain
,
discomfort
from
overuse
of
my
<

``

''

=
``

,
and
soreness
from
tough
PT
sessions
.
But
although
it
did
not
all
come
easily
,
it\xe2\x80\x99s
all
been
beyond
worth
it.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'If
you
told
me
six
months
ago
that
I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
this
happy
right
now
,
I
would\xe2\x80\x99ve
probably
said
something
like
,
\xe2\x80\x9csure
,
keep
telling
yourself
that.\xe2\x80\x9d
I
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
believe
that
life
would
ever
be
bright
and
happy
again
.
Now
,
though
,
I
wake
up
each
day
with
gratitude
in
my
heart
for
how
far
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
gotten
.
I
am
so
thankful
for
everyone
who
has
followed
my
story
,
sent
prayers
my
way
,
and
supported
me
through
it
all
.
Who
would\xe2\x80\x99ve
known
that
something
so
dark
and
so
scary
could
give
way
to
something
so
beautiful
?
I
am
humbled
to
be
where
I
am
today.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Those
tears
and
those
fears
on
the
morning
of
my
surgery
would
have
disappeared
immediately
if
I
would
have
known
then
how
amazing
my
life
would
soon
become
.
I
am
so
undeserving
of
this
wonderful
journey
,
but
I
am
so
grateful
for
the
life
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
been
given.\n

'ENCOUNTERING
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
DIFFERENT\n
'
,
'The
other
day
,
I
was
in
the
store
when
I
heard
a
little
girl
call
out
to
her
mom
.
\xe2\x80\x9cMom
,
come
here
!
Mom
!
That
girl\xe2\x80\x93why
does
she
look\xe2\x80\x93
?
\xe2\x80\x9d
Her
mom
tried
to
hush
her
before
she
went
on
.
\xe2\x80\x9cShh
.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll
explain
it
to
you
,
but
you
have
to
come
over
here
,
\xe2\x80\x9d
she
said
,
leading
her
daughter
to
a
different
area
.
When
they
came
back
to
where
I
was
,
the
girl
and
her
brother
tried
to
catch
another
glance
at
my
<
object
value
=
``
prosthetic
leg
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
SEM
''
>
leg
<
/object
>
while
their
mom
tried
to
stop
them
from
staring
by
offering
other
things
to
look
at.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
think
situations
like
the
one
described
above
come
from
the
desire
to
not
intrude
or
offend
.
We
don\xe2\x80\x99t
want
to
say
or
do
the
wrong
thing
,
especially
around
people
who
are
\xe2\x80\x9cdifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s
totally
understandable
,
but
sometimes
I
think
our
avoidance
is
counterproductive
.
When
I
hear
people
talking
about
my
<
object
value
=
``
prosthetic
leg
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
SEM
''
>
leg
<
/object
>
in
hushed
voices
,
or
pulling
their
kids
away
from
me
to
talk
about
what
they
think
happened
,
it
only
magnifies
the
idea
that
something
is
\xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d
with
me
.
(
Side
note
:
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
actually
think
anything
is
wrong
with
me
,
and
the
world
knows
how
proud
I
am
of
my
<
object
value
=
``
prosthetic
leg
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
EM
''
>
leg
<
/object
>
.
But
when
situations
like
this
happen
,
it
communicates
that
idea
to
others
.
The
idea
that
something
is
wrong
and
that
it
shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
be
talked
about
.
But
it
should
.
)
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Everyone
is
different
,
but
for
me
personally
,
I\xe2\x80\x99d
rather
people
just
ask
about
what
happened
rather
than
trying
to
conjure
their
own
explanations
.
I
am
an
open
book
,
as
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
said
multiple
times
.
I\xe2\x80\x99d
rather
answer
questions
personally
than
have
people
get
the
wrong
impression
about
my
amputation.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'People
try
to
avoid
awkward
conversations
and
uncomfortable
situations
.
I
think
that\xe2\x80\x99s
normal
.
But
there
are
ways
to
acknowledge
these
things
without
making
a
bigger
deal
out
of
it
.
The
mother
that
I
described
could
have
simply
told
her
kids
that
I
had
a
<
object
value
=
``
prosthetic
leg
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
SEM
''
>
prosthetic
leg
<
/object
>
and
let
it
at
that
.
She
could
have
said
something
that
would
allow
her
kids
to
know
that
disabilities
and
differences
are
to
be
celebrated
,
not
shushed
.
Instead
of
making
her
children
feel
like
they
did
something
wrong
by
asking
about
my
<
object
value
=
``
prosthetic
leg
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``
perm
''
status
=
``
final
''
agreement
=
``
SEM
''
>
leg
<
/object
>
,
she
could
have
been
honest
with
them.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
am
not
trying
to
criticize
the
mom
in
the
story
,
because
I
know
that
she
was
probably
just
trying
to
be
sensitive
to
my
feelings
.
I
get
that
.
I
can
be
awkward
around
people
who
are
different
sometimes
,
too
.
But
I
use
the
story
above
to
show
that
there
are
different
ways
to
go
about
handling
situations
.
I
can\xe2\x80\x99t
speak
for
everyone
,
but
here
are
some
things
that
I
think
would
be
helpful
when
encountering
people
with
disabilities
or
people
who
look/talk/act
differently
from
you
:
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'-Treat
people
like
humans
,
not
problems
or
disabilities
.
Underneath
our
metal
legs
and
battle
scars
,
we
are
all
humans
.
We
have
emotions
,
thoughts
,
and
lives
just
like
you
.
Treat
us
like
you\xe2\x80\x99d
treat
anyone
else.\n
'
,
'\xe2\x80\x93Smile
.
A
simple
,
non-condescending
smile
can
go
a
long
way.\n
'
,
'-Don\xe2\x80\x99t
be
afraid
of
us
!
Fake
legs
,
wheelchairs
,
and
machines
are
not
scary
monsters
.
They
are
simply
necessities
that
help
us
to
live
the
best
life
possible
.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t
fear
what
you
do
not
know
.
Seriously.\n
'
,
'\xe2\x80\x93If
you
are
with
kids
and
they
ask
questions
,
answer
in
a
positive
light
.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t
shut
down
their
curiosity
.
Rather
than
trying
to
silence
them
,
give
them
some
information
.
\xe2\x80\x9cThat
girl
uses
a
cool
leg
to
walk
.
Isn\xe2\x80\x99t
it
neat
?
\xe2\x80\x9d
or
\xe2\x80\x9cYes
,
she
has
a
scar
,
but
isn\xe2\x80\x99t
it
beautiful
?
\xe2\x80\x9d\n
'
,
'\xe2\x80\x93Don\xe2\x80\x99t
make
assumptions
about
our
stories
.
If
you
want
to
know
what
happened
,
ask
.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t
try
to
tell
your
kids
that
someone
was
sick
or
something
if
you
don\xe2\x80\x99t
truly
know
the
story
.
In
the
case
of
amputation
,
there
are
multiple
reasons
why
someone
could
end
up
that
way
.
Some
people
are
born
without
limbs
.
Some
were
sick
,
while
others
had
traumatic
accidents
.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t
make
up
stories
to
explain
our
differences.\n
'
,
'-If
you
really
want
to
know
something
,
ask
politely
.
Some
people
are
uncomfortable
acknowledging
the
\xe2\x80\x9celephant
in
the
room
,
\xe2\x80\x9d
but
the
worst
that
will
happen
is
they
will
tell
you
that
they\xe2\x80\x99d
rather
not
talk
about
it
.
Trust
me
,
you\xe2\x80\x99re
probably
not
the
first
person
to
ask
them
a
question
.
Many
people
are
happy
to
talk
about
it
.
Just
don\xe2\x80\x99t
be
rude
with
your
words.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
am
aware
that
this
is
an
area
where
people
don\xe2\x80\x99t
know
what
to
do
.
I
wish
that
weren\xe2\x80\x99t
the
case
,
since
we\xe2\x80\x99re
all
humans
and
our
level
of
ability
shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
cause
such
awkwardness
,
but
that\xe2\x80\x99s
how
it
is
.
The
net
time
you
see
someone
who
is

remember
that
they
have
a
story

They
have
a
life

person
who
deserves
to
be
respected
,

you
don\xe2\x80\x99t

be
uncomfortable
around
them

When
in
doubt

choose
kindness

LETTING

IMG_2363For
someone
who
loves
to
have
everything
planned
out
,
this
season
of
life
has
been\xe2\x80\xa6well
,
a
bit
hectic
.
I
guess
it\xe2\x80\x99s
really
more
than
just
a
season
,
since
my
life
has
been
one
change
after
another
for
the
past
nine
years
or
so
.
It
has
been
a
constant
journey
of
trusting
that
everything
will
somehow
work
out
,
even
when
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
understand
what
is
happening
in
a
given
moment.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Just
when
I
start
to
get
settled
and
comfortable
,
something
happens
to
change
up
my
plans
.
This
has
been
particularly
evident
lately
in
my
academic
life
.
I
think
I
know
where
I\xe2\x80\x99m
going
and
what
I
want
to
do
,
and
then\xe2\x80\x93BAM\xe2\x80\x93something
changes
.
I
think
that\xe2\x80\x99s
pretty
normal
for
college
students
,
though
.
Most
people
change
majors
more
than
once
,
so
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
feel
too
abnormal
about
that
.
Many
people
also
change
schools\xe2\x80\xa6which
I
also
have
done
.
But
I
think
that
part
of
my
identity
has
been
wrapped
up
in
who
I
wanted
to
be
and
what
I
wanted
to
do
in
the
future
,
which
is
why
this
newest
change
in
my
life
has
been
necessary
but
difficult.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'For
the
past
few
years
,
I
have
had
a
plan
about
my
future
career
goals
.
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
study
,
looked
into
different
ways
to
get
my
degree
,
and
thought
everything
was
good
to
go
.
Friends
and
family
commented
on
how
great
of
a
career
choice
I
had
,
and
how
wonderful
it
was
that
I
would
be
getting
my
Master\xe2\x80\x99s
degree
within
the
next
few
years
.
Along
the
way
,
though
,
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
hit
several
roadblocks
,
detours
,
and
signs
that
maybe
there
was
something
else
that
I
was
supposed
to
do
.
My
dreams
were
good
,
but
maybe
they
weren\xe2\x80\x99t
the
best.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Lately
,
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
been
feeling
a
push
to
leave
my
desired
major
and
take
a
different
path
.
It\xe2\x80\x99s
been
a
huge
topic
of
discussion
and
debate
,
a
process
of
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
going
with
the
new
plan
that
I
feel
led
toward
.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
done
some
research
,
talked
to
multiple
people
,
and
discussed
things
with
the
Big
Man
upstairs
.
Although
it\xe2\x80\x99s
hard
to
push
aside
the
ideal
plans
that
I
had
made
,
it
has
become
more
clear
that
something
else
is
up
ahead
.
Something
that
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
fully
understand
right
now
,
but
that
I
hope
will
make
more
sense
along
the
way.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'As
of
this
week
,
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
decided
to
let
go
of
my
previous
plans
and
go
down
a
different
road
.
I\xe2\x80\x99m
switching
majors
and
hoping
to
graduate
next
year
rather
than
in
three
years
.
My
identity
will
no
longer
be
held
in
my
career
aspirations
.
It\xe2\x80\x99s
something
that
I\xe2\x80\x99m
feeling
a
sense
of
peace
about
,
so
this
is
the
way
I
am
choosing
to
go
.
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
know
what
the
future
holds
in
terms
of
my
education
and
career
,
but
at
least
I
have
a
start.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Even
though
I
feel
peace
about
my
decision
,
letting
go
of
my
plans
is
not
easy
.
Sometimes
I
think
that
I
know
what\xe2\x80\x99s
best
for
my
life
,
so
I
cling
to
my
\xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d
plan
.
But
in
reality
,
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
always
know
what\xe2\x80\x99s
best
.
Other
people
see
things
that
I
am
blind
to
.
I
feel
nudges
about
taking
a
different
route
.
I
do
not
always
know
the
best
way
to
live
my
life
.
Even
when
it\xe2\x80\x99s
challenging
,
I
need
to
let
go
of
my
plans
and
let
Him
take
charge
.
I\xe2\x80\x99m
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
all
plays
out
in
the
future.\n

'Guess
what
happened
yesterday
?
Well
,
if
you\xe2\x80\x99ve
read
the
title
,
then
you
know\xe2\x80\xa6I
had
my
last
day
of
Physical
Therapy
!
Even
though
I\xe2\x80\x99m
going
to
miss
going
over
to
the
hospital
on
a
regular
basis
,
I\xe2\x80\x99m
happy
that
I
am
well
enough
to
leave
behind
the
days
of
multiple
appointments
per
week.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'It\xe2\x80\x99s
so
encouraging
to
look
back
and
see
how
far
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
come
in
the
past
3
months
or
so
since
I
received
my
<

<

and
began
PT
.
When
I
started
therapy
in
February
,
I
was
still
using
both
crutches
.
I
did
not
trust
my
<

``

leg
''

''

<
/object

at
all
and
I
had
a
terrible
limp
.
My
knee
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
able
to
fully
extend
because
of
the
contracture
that
had
been
present
for
so
long
.
I
occasionally
tried
to
leave
the
crutches
behind
,
but
I
always
felt
the
need
to
go
back
to
them
for
safety
and
stability
.
I
remember
my
therapist
telling
me
that
it
would
take
some
time
before
I
was
able
to
walk
unassisted
.
I
so
desperately
wanted
to
jump
ahead
and
be
walking
and
running
freely
,
but
I
knew
that
there
was
a
process
that
I
needed
to
go
through
first.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Once
I
finally
ditched
the
crutches
about
a
month
after
starting
therapy
,
I
moved
to
a
cane
.
I
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
like
that
very
much
,
mostly
because
it
made
me
feel
too
old
.
I
used
the
cane
occasionally
,
but
tried
to
limp
around
without
it
.
I
still
had
some
strengthening
to
do
,
but
it
was
a
huge
step
to
leave
the
crutches
behind.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Finally
,
after
deciding
that
my
cane-using
days
were
over
,
I
began
walking
unassisted\xe2\x80\xa6all
the
time
.
My
PT
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
very
big
into
that
idea
at
first
because
she
knew
that
I
still
had
some
weakness
that
we
needed
to
take
care
of
,
so
I
still
used
the
cane
in
our
sessions
.
Gradually
,
I
noticed
that
my
trust
in
my
<
object
value
=
``
prosthetic
leg
''
id
=
``
1
''
type
=
``

''

increased
and
my
limp
decreased.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Now
,
I
only
have
a
slight
limp
that
most
people
probably
don\xe2\x80\x99t
notice
.
Sure
,
it
gets
worse
when
I\xe2\x80\x99m
tired
or
in
pain
,
but
for
the
most
part
,
my
muscles
are
strong
and
my
body
is
stable
.
Oh
,
and
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
regained
almost
all
of
the
range
of
motion
in
my
knee
,
which
is
a
HUGE
deal
!
I\xe2\x80\x99m
able
to
walk
,
jog
,
hike
,
canoe
,
go
to
the
beach\xe2\x80\xa6basically
,
I\xe2\x80\x99m
free
to
do
whatever
I
want
!
I
have
to
wait
a
few
months
before
I
can
talk
to
my
doctor
about
getting
a
running
leg
,
which
I
would
love
to
have
,
and
I
might
see
about
getting
a
swimming
leg
in
the
future
.
I\xe2\x80\x99m
determined
to
enjoy
life
and
push
through
as
many
so-called
limits
as
possible
!

'Many
thanks

out

Without

I

have
gotten
this
far

She
helped
me
overcome
my
challenges

one
wobbly
step
at
a
time

It
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
always
easy

every

showed
me
how
strong

capable
my

I
am
so
,
so
grateful
to
have
my
life
back

Not

IMG_0976Happy
Mother\xe2\x80\x99s
Day
to
all
the
wonderful
moms
,
moms-to-be
,
and
people
who
take
on
the
role
of
a
mom
out
there
!
It
takes
a
special
person
to
be
a
great
mom
.
I
am
thankful
to
have
an
incredible
mom
who
blesses
me
on
a
daily
basis
,
and
I
could
never
thank
her
enough
for
all
that
she
does
for
my
family.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'To
those
out
there
who
struggle
with
this
holiday
for
whatever
reason
,
know
that
I
am
thinking
about
you
especially
today
.
I
know
people
who
have
broken
relationships
or
who
are
desperate
to
become
a
mom
,
and
I
am
thinking
about
those
brave
women
who
have
to
watch
as
everyone
else
celebrates
and
changes
their
Facebook
profile
photos
or
posts
pictures
of
their
mom
on
Instagram
.
I\xe2\x80\x99m
sure
days
like
today
only
add
salt
to
the
wounds
,
but
I
hope
and
pray
that
better
days
are
ahead
and
the
holiday
will
soon
be
a
reason
for
joy.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
believe
that
my
mom
deserves
an
extra
bit
of
recognition
today
.
It
takes
a
fierce
momma
to
deal
with
a
kid
who
has
a
chronic
illness
.
I
don\xe2\x80\x99t
think
she
looked
at
my
face
when
I
was
born
and
envisioned
countless
nights
on
tiny
hospital
beds
or
endless
days
filled
with
worry
.
She
never
planned
on
having
to
watch
as
her
daughter
screamed
bloody
murder
while
she
was
forced
to
stand
there
,
unable
to
help
.
I\xe2\x80\x99m
pretty
sure
she
never
imagined
she\xe2\x80\x99d
be
sending
her
child
across
the
country
to
the
middle
of
the
desert
at
age
15
,
to
Nashville
at
age
16
,
or
to
Cleveland
multiple
times
,
all
for
lengthy
stays
with
limited
contact
.
In
her
dreams
about
becoming
a
mom
,
I\xe2\x80\x99m
positive
that
RSD
,
eating
disorders
,
or
amputation
never
crossed
her
mind
.
She
never
signed
up
for
any
of
this
,
and
yet
,
that\xe2\x80\x99s
what
she\xe2\x80\x99s
had
to
deal
with.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'My
mom
has
handled
all
of
my
issues
with
such
love
and
grace
.
She
has
dealt
with
horrible
doctors
,
crappy
sleeping
situations
,
distance
from
her
family
and
other
kids
,
and
messy
situations\xe2\x80\xa6all
for
me
.
She
flew
me
all
the
way
to
Arizona
and
had
the
courage
to
walk
away
from
me
,
knowing
that
leaving
her
daughter
in
this
unfamiliar
place
was
what
was
necessary
to
save
my
life
.
When
that
place
did
its
job
as
being
\xe2\x80\x9clife
support\xe2\x80\x9d
temporarily
but
failed
in
the
long
run
,
she
once
again
took
me
to
a
new
state
and
said
goodbye
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
It\xe2\x80\x99s
not
in
a
(
good
)
mother\xe2\x80\x99s
nature
to
be
willing
to
send
her
children
away
,
but
she
did
it
because
she
knew
that
that
was
what
I
needed
.
She
sacrificed
her
own
pain
and
heartache
for
the
possibility
that
I
would
have
a
better
life.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'When
I
was
told
that
I
needed
to
have
my
leg
amputated
,
my
mom
stood
beside
me
.
She
is
the
one
who
insisted
that
my
doctor\xe2\x80\x99s
appointment
be
moved
up
to
an
earlier
date
,
and
without
that
,
I
very
well
could
have
died
from
the
infection
that
was
invading
my
body
.
She
agreed
to
support
me
in
my
decision
to
make
it
a
positive
experience
.
I
can\xe2\x80\x99t
imagine
that
it\xe2\x80\x99s
easy
to
watch
your
daughter
being
wheeled
into
an
Operating
Room
,
knowing
that
she\xe2\x80\x99ll
come
out
with
a
missing
limb
,
but
she
let
the
doctors
do
their
job
.
She\xe2\x80\x99s
been
the
best
amputee
momma
out
there
,
supporting
me
through
it
all.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
can\xe2\x80\x99t
even
imagine
the
amount
of
time
my
mom
has
spent
praying
for
me
,
crying
for
me
,
and
worrying
about
me
.
She
had
to
deal
with
my
anger
and
harsh
words
toward
her
when
I
was
writhing
in
pain
,
both
physically
and
emotionally
.
She
had
to
listen
as
I
screamed
and
shouted
about
how
much
I
wished
I
were
dead
,
and
she
often
had
to
go
against
my
own
(
unhealthy
)
wishes
because
she
knew
what
was
best
for
me.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'My
mom
has
been
through
so
much
but
she
continues
to
embrace
life
with
a
smile
.
Rather
than
giving
up
when
things
got
tough
,
she
pressed
on
and
has
served
as
an
encouragement
and
inspiration
to
those
around
her
.
She
always
reminds
me
how
much
I
am
loved
and
how
proud
she
is
to
be
my
mom
,
even
when
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
put
her
through
hell
and
back
.
I
will
never
fully
fathom
how
strong
she
is
and
the
deepness
of
her
love
and
sacrifice
for
my

'FLYING
AS
AN
AMPUTEE\n
'
,
'Processed
with
MoldivLast
week
,
I
took
a
trip
to
Delaware
to
spend
some
time
with
my
brother
and
our
awesome
family
friends
.
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
flown
since
my
amputation
,
so
I
wasn\xe2\x80\x99t
completely
sure
what
to
expect
.
With
the
heightened
security
these
days
,
I
wondered
if
I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
hassled
about

'We
arrived
at
the

in
the
evening

things
were
relatively
empty

so
that
the
TSA
agents
could
easily
identify
me
as
an
amputee
.
(
I
figured
that\xe2\x80\x99d
be
better
than
sliding
through
the
metal
detector
and
beeping
.

When
one
of

she
told
me
to
step
into
the

She
was
very
friendly

commenting

.
I
used
to
struggle
with
getting
on
the
plane
and
finding
a
spot
for
my
aluminum
sidekicks
.
This
time
,
it
was
just
me
and

which
was
securely
fastened
to
my

.
I
opted
to
forego
pre
boarding
since
I
consider
myself
to
be
as
able-bodied
as
anyone
else
.
When
our
zone
was
called
,
we
headed
to
our
seats
and
sat
down.\n

,
'\n
'
,
'I
was
very
happy
with
how
smoothly
things
went
during
my
trip
.
After
having
some
not-so-pleasant
flying
experiences
in
the
past
,
this
felt
like
a
breeze
.
The
flight
attendants
played
movie
trivia
with
us
while
we
waited
to
depart
,
and
the
flight
was
comfortable.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'On
the
way
home
,
security
was
more
strict

I
had
to
take
off

but
I
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
have
too
many
issues
.
I
was
once
again
scanned
,
swiped
,
and
sent
on

'If
you\xe2\x80\x99re
flying
as
an
amputee
,
here
are
some
tips
that
I
think
helped
my
experience
:
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'-Wear
shorts/short-sleeved
shirts
(
depending
on
where
your
amputation
happened
)
so
that
you
can
be
easily
identified
as
an
amputee
.
It\xe2\x80\x99s
much
better
than
making
the
metal
detector
go
crazy
!
Plus
,
it
is
easier
for
the
TSA
agents
to
access
your
prosthetic
(
if
you
have
one
)
so
that
they
can
test
it
for
any
harmful
substances.\n
'
,
'-Wear
shoes
that
are
easy
to
remove
.
If
you
are
a
lower
limb
amputee
with
a
prosthetic
leg
such
as
myself
,
you
may
have
to
take
off
your
shoes
.
It\xe2\x80\x99s
better
to
wear
comfortable
shoes
that
you
can
quickly
take
on
and
off.\n
'
,
'-If
you
have
the
option
,
don\xe2\x80\x99t
wear
too
many
socks
.
Your
limbs
tend
to
swell
a
bit
while
flying
,
so
if
you
have
too
many
socks
on
your
limb
,
you
may
feel
uncomfortable
tightness.\n
'
,
'-Relax
and
enjoy
your
time
!
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
love
to
travel
,
and
it
is
such
a
relief
to
know
that
flying
as
an
amputee
isn\xe2\x80\x99t

IMG_1188Each
day
gives
us
24
hours
.
Sometimes
we
wish
for
more
time
to
get
things
done
,
but
there
are
other
times
when
we
aren\xe2\x80\x99t
even
sure
if
we
can
make
it
through
the
day
without
a
breakdown
.
At
least
that\xe2\x80\x99s
how
it
is
for
me
.
But
regardless
of
what
happens
,
each
day
only
has
24
hours.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'At
a
recent
meeting
that
I
attended
,
someone
shared
about
the
5
principles
of
Reiki
.
Aside
from
doing
some
quick
research
on
this
practice
when
I
was
talked
into
trying
it
while
in
the
hospital
a
few
years
back
,
I
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
know
much
about
it
.
I
still
don\xe2\x80\x99t
,
really
,
and
I
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
find
it
to
be
an
effective
healing
technique
in
my
personal
situation
.
Regardless
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
Reiki
,
I
appreciated
the
content
of
the
5
principles
that
were
shared
:
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Just
for
today
,
I
will
not
anger.\n
'
,
'Just
for
today
,
I
will
not
worry.\n
'
,
'Just
for
today
,
I
will
be
honest.\n
'
,
'Just
for
today
,
I
will
be
grateful.\n
'
,
'Just
for
today
,
I
will
be
compassionate
toward
myself
and
others.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'As
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
gone
through
the
past
few
weeks
,
I
have
reflected
on
these
principles
.
Am
I
refraining
from
anger
?
Am
I
allowing
my
faith
to
be
bigger
than
my
fear
?
Am
I
being
honest
?
Am
I
taking
time
to
show
my
gratitude
and
appreciation
,
even
for
the
little
things
?
Am
I
giving
myself
the
grace
that
I
need
and
being
compassionate
toward
others
?
It\xe2\x80\x99s
good
to
be
mindful
of
our
actions
so
that
we
know
how
to
improve.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
believe
that
these
are
five
important
things
that
can
be
difficult
at
times
,
but
really
have
the
power
to
change
our
mindset
.
By
focusing
on
one
day
at
a
time
,
they
don\xe2\x80\x99t
seem
as
tough
to
accomplish
.
Just
for

,
you
can
keep
going
.
Just
for
today
,
you
can
choose
to
be
positive

Just
for
today
,
you
can
remember
that
there
is
life
to
be
lived

Tomorrow
has
its
own
worries
,
but
just
for
today
,
you
can
handle
what\xe2\x80\x99s
in
front
of
you
.
And
with
each
new
day
,
you
can
start
fresh
with
the
idea
that
something
wonderful
is
going
to
happen
.
Even
the
darkest
moments
can
have
glimmers
of
light
if
you
take
the
time
to
look
closely
and
choose
to
see
things
through
eyes
of
gratitude
and
positivity

Just

can
be
strong
and
hold
on.\n

'LIMB
LOSS
AWARENESS
MONTH\n
'
,
'
Processed
with
MoldivHow
is
it
almost
May
?
!
Before
time
slips
away
any
faster
,
I
figured
I
should
squeeze
in
a
post
about
why
April
is
an
important
month
.
Do
you
know
what\xe2\x80\x99s
special
about
this
month
of
the
year
?
(
Well
,
besides
the
birds
chirping
,
warmer
temperatures
,
and
the
anticipation
of
summer
.
)
In
case
you
haven\xe2\x80\x99t
already
caught
on
from
my
post
title
and
the
featured
image
,
April
is
Limb
Loss
Awareness
Month
!
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Last
April
,
I
had
no
clue
that
it
was
such
a
significant
month
for
awareness
.
Amputation
,
in
my
mind
,
was
never
going
to
become
a
personal
experience
.
But
now
that
I\xe2\x80\x99m
an
amputee
?
I
see
April
as
a
way
to
celebrate
life
and
spread
awareness
about
taking
care
of
your
limbs
so
you
don\xe2\x80\x99t
have
to
go
through
the
terrifying
wonderful
process
of
joining
the
amputee
club.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Here\xe2\x80\x99s
the
deal
:
chances
are
,
you\xe2\x80\x99ll
never
even
have
to
think
about
becoming
an
amputee
.
I
mean
,
most
people
make
it
through
life
with
all
their
limbs
intact
.
However
,
bodies
are
funny
and
life
is
strange
,
and
you
never
know
when
you
or
a
loved
one
may
become
a
potential
amputee.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Each
day
,
more
than
500
Americans
become
amputees
.
(
Statistic
from
the
Amputee
Coalition
)
That
seems
like
a
lot
,
right
?
To
me
it
does
.
There
are
numerous
causes
for
peoples\xe2\x80\x99
amputations
,
some
which
are
preventable
.
Regardless
of
the
cause
,
with
so
many
people
becoming
amputees
daily
,
awareness
about
amputation
is
important.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Why
is
awareness
important
?
Well
,
first
of
all
,
many
people
do
not
know
how
to
react
to
amputees
.
Parents
tell
their
kids
not
to
stare
.
People
shy
away
from
the
subject
.
Sometimes
the
fact
that
someone
is
different
brings
up
questions
or
awkwardness
and
people
don\xe2\x80\x99t
know
how
what
to
do
.
Now
that
I
am
on
the
other
side
of
things
,
I
realize
that
each
amputee
has
been
on
a
unique
journey
to
get
to
where
they
are
.
Some
want
to
forget
that
it
ever
happened
,
while
others
are
completely
fine
with
their
amputation
.
Either
way
,
amputees
should
be
treated
like
the
normal
human
beings
that
they
(
we
)
are
.
We\xe2\x80\x99re
not
aliens
or
robots
just
because
we
may
have
metal
limbs
!
Our
differences
don\xe2\x80\x99t
have
to
be
scary.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Awareness
is
also
important
because
many
times
,
amputation
can
be
prevented
with
proper
care
.
We\xe2\x80\x99re
only
given
one
body
while
we\xe2\x80\x99re
here
on
this
earth
,
so
it
is
critical
that
we
take
care
of
ourselves
.
Making
positive
lifestyle
choices
can
help
avoid
health
problems
.
Becoming
aware
of
changes
in
our
bodies
is
also
important
so
that
issues
can
be
resolved
before
they
spiral
out
of
control
.
Take
me
for
example
.
If
I
would\xe2\x80\x99ve
gone
to
the
doctor
when
I
first
noticed
signs
of
my
limb
breaking
down
instead
of
waiting
until
things
became
irreversible
,
then
I
might
not
have
ended
up
where
I
am
today
.
My
fear
of
doctors
kept
me
from
seeking
help
,
but
now
I
know
that
the
right
doctors
will
do
anything
they
can
to
make
sure
their
patients\xe2\x80\x99
needs
are
taken
care
of.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'I
am
a
proud
amputee
and
I
am
grateful
for
how
far
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
come
since
my
surgery
five
months
ago
.
I
hope
that
as
awareness
increases
,
my
fellow
amputees
will
realize
that
they
are
not
alone
.
Amputation
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
have
to
mean
isolation
or
the
end
of
a
happy
,
fulfilling
life
.
I
also
hope
that
non-amputees
will
realize
that
amputees
are
just
like
anybody
else
,
and
there\xe2\x80\x99s
no
need
to
fear
what
you
don\xe2\x80\x99t
understand
.
If
you
have
any
questions
about
the
amputee
life
,
know
that
you
can
always
ask
me
!
I
love
telling
people
about
my
journey
and
spreading
awareness
about
amputation.\n

I

many
times
this
weekend
as
I
sat
in

audience

life
together.\n

'5
MONTHS
&
A
5K
!
\n
'
,
'Five
months
ago
today
,
I
was
sleeping
in
my
hospital
room
after
having
my
leg
amputated
.
My
doctors
weren\xe2\x80\x99t
sure
how
well
I
would
recover
from
surgery
.
Would
I
walk
again
?
Surely
I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
in
pain
,
they
thought
.
My
Leg
Guy
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
know
if
I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
able
to
wear
a
prosthesis
because
of
my
issues
with
sensitivity
.
My
medical
team
all
thought
that
maybe
I\xe2\x80\x99d
walk
,
but
they
weren\xe2\x80\x99t
sure
if
I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
able
to
do
more
than
that.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'This
morning
,
exactly
5
months
after
surgery
,
my
dad
and
I
drove
to
the
hospital
where
my
leg
was
removed
.
This
time
,
instead
of
being
in
a
boring
hospital
gown
with
tubes
hanging
from
my
body
,
I
was
sporting
a
snazzy

.
In
place
of
my
old
bandages
that
were
once
wrapped
around
my
limb
,
I
was
proudly
showing
off
my

.
On
the
campus
of
the
hospital
where
I
once
broke
down
sobbing
over
the
idea
of
losing
my
leg
,
I
was
preparing
to
participate
in
a
5K.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'My
dad
and
I
were
joined
by
our
awesome
friends
who
have
walked
alongside
me
during
the
past
few
years
of
my
crazy
journey
.
It
was
great
to
have
Dee
and
her
kids
with
us
because
they
have
been
so
encouraging
to
me
,
both
before
and
after
my
surgery
.
I
watch
the
kids
every
week
,
and
they
were
a
big
reason
why
I
was
motivated
to
get
up
and
walk
again\xe2\x80\x93I
wanted
to
be
able
to
play
outside
and
do
fun
things
with
them
!
It
felt
like
things
were
coming
around
full
circle\xe2\x80\x93after
going
through
the
darkest
storm
,
the
clouds
had
finally
cleared
and
I
was
enjoying
freedom
while
being
surrounded
by
incredible
people.\n

Together
we
will

\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'After
doing
our
warmups
and
laughing
at
how
many
times
the
instructor
talked
about
ankle
mobility
,
noting
the
fact
that
I
can\xe2\x80\x99t
exactly
move
my
right
ankle
on
my
own
,
we
waved
to
the
drone
in
the
air
and
began
the
race
.
It
was
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
I
was
actually
participating
in
a
5K
.
I
did
one
a
few
years
ago
,
but
I
figured
that
with
my
health
issues
,
that
would
be
the
one
and

doing

(
I
get
to
talk
to
my
Leg
Guy
and
doctor
about
getting
one
of
those
in
September
)
,
so
most
of
the
time
was
spent
walking
.
I
tried
to
jog
a
bit
but
I
think
it
looked
more
like
a
beginner\xe2\x80\x99s
Irish
jig
than
a
graceful
run
.
That\xe2\x80\x99s
okay
,
though
,
because
I
was
just
happy
to
be
moving
!

'Never
in
my
wildest
dreams
did
I
imagine
that
I\xe2\x80\x99d
be
doing
this
well
right
now
.
Before
surgery
,
I
had
gone
through
a
bit
of
an
acceptance
phase
when
I
realized
that
I
probably
wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
get
better
.
People
said
I\xe2\x80\x99d
never
walk
again
,
which
meant
that
running
was
far
out
of
the
realm
of
possibilities
.
Never
say
never
,
right
?
Today
,
as
I
ran
across
the
finish
line
,
I
celebrated
the
fact
that
I
was
able
to
finally
prove
them
wrong
.
I
am
hoping
that
this
is
just
the
beginning
of
a
new
,
active
lifestyle
.
I\xe2\x80\x99m
grateful
for
where
I
am
right
now
and
I
am
trying
to
enjoy
every
moment
,
knowing
all
too
well
how
things
can
change
suddenly
.
(
Of
course
,
I\xe2\x80\x99m
not
expecting
anything
bad
to
happen
,
but
I
plan
on
living
my
life
to
the
fullest
as
long
as
I
can
.

'WHO\xe2\x80\x99S
ON
MY
TEAM
?
\n
'
,
'When
you
become
an
amputee
,
you
are
basically
forced
to
interact
with
several
medical
professionals
.
Besides
the
obvious
people
who
are
there
when
your
surgery
first
happens
,
you
develop
a
team
of
people
who
have
different
roles
in
your
care
after
you
go
home
.
I
find
myself
at
the
hospital
at
least
twice
a
week
because
of
all
the
appointments
I
get
to
go
to
.
Soon
,
the
frequency
of
my
visits
will
lower
,
but
for
now
I
am
enjoying
the
time
I
get
to
spend
at
St.
Joe\xe2\x80\x99s.\n

'
,
'So\xe2\x80\xa6who\xe2\x80\x99s
on
my
post-op
care
team
?
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
gotten
some
questions
about
how
my
appointments
have
been
going
,
and
when/where
they
happen
.
Here
are
some
of
the
amazing
people

my

off

Before

,
I
was
in
his
office
multiple
times
per
week
to
see
a
wonderful
nurse
for
dressing
changes
.
Now
,
my
visits
are
more
spread
out\xe2\x80\x93in
fact
,
the
next
time
I
see
him
won\xe2\x80\x99t
be
until
July
!
I
still
see
him
and
the
people
from
his
office
sometimes
when
I\xe2\x80\x99m
roaming
around

he
is
the
one
who
signs
the
paperwork
when
I\xe2\x80\x99m
ready
to
get
a
new
leg
.
I
see
him
at
Amputee

once
every
few

We
chat
for
a
few
minutes
and
he
checks

loads
of

Really
,
it
is
!
It\xe2\x80\x99s
so
exciting
to
look
at
how
much
progress
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
made
each
week
.
I
see
my
Physical
Therapist
twice
a
week
,
and
we
do
a
lot
of
strengthening
exercises
(
leg
press
,
resistance
bands
,
etc
)
among
other
things
.
We
are
currently
working
hard
to
get
rid
of
my
limp
,
which
means
my
muscles
need
to
get
stronger
!
I\xe2\x80\x99ve
met
most
of
my
goals
,
so
I
only
have
a
few
PT
visits
left
.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll
still
have
to
do
my
exercises
at

I
won\xe2\x80\x99t
have

wake
up
early

Okay

so
this
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
really
fit
into

you
are

so
amazing

I
would
not
be
where
I
am
today
without

not

'Some
thoughts
about
moving
to
a
new
country
(
and
packing
for
it
)
\r\n
'

'As
I
enjoy
my
last
day
in
D\xc3\xbcsseldorf
,
there
are
lots
of
thoughts
going
through
my
head
.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
moved
abroad
back
in
2005
as
a
college
student
--
I
actually
sobbed
to
my
mother
for
three
hours
.
Maybe
more
.
I
recall
wailing
to
her
,
``
But
why
am
I
even
going
abroad
?
!
I
feel
comfortable
where
I
am
and
I
like
it
here
!
!
What
am
I
doing
?
!
?
''
Nine
years
later
,
eight
of
which
have
been
spent
outside
the
U.S.
,
I
can
only
laugh
at
my
college
self
and
think
,
``
How
cute
.
''
Because
honestly
,
I
wouldn\'t
change
the
last
nine
years
at
all.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
I
have
the
feeling
that
in
Shanghai
,
I
will
constantly
be
comparing
it
to
my
German
experience
.
I
realize
though
that
this
is
unfair
.
D\xc3\xbcsseldorf
consistently
ranks
in
the
top
10
most
livable
cities
in
Europe
,
if
not
the
world
,
according
to
the
Mercer
Quality
of
Living
Survey
.
On
the
other
hand
,
China
ranks
as
the
number
one
country
for
expats
according
to
the
BBC
.
But
does
living
as
an
expat
actually
mean
a
good
quality
of
life
?
I
do
n't
think
it
necessarily
does
,
but
this
will
probably
be
one
of
the
bigger
questions
I
answer
in
China.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
'One
thing
that
worries
me
about
living
in
China
is
being
Chinese-American
,
but
my
Mandarin
is
only
so-so
.
Of
course
,
I\
'm
eager
to
improve
it
,
but
there
is
an
expectation
that
if
you
look
Asian
,
you
speak
the
local
language
.
It\
's
a
common
problem
in
Asia
that
I
encountered
in
Beijing
,
Tokyo
,
and
Kyoto
.
The
attitude
is
,
``
Why
don\'t
you
speak
the
local
language
?
You\
're
Asian
!

I
didn\'t
actually
wind
up
making

I
do
take
that
into

Anything
that

can\'t
be
combined

anything

doesn\'t
get
packed

which
was
the
dead
giveaway
that
I\
'm
not

I
actually

bringing

I
thought
,
``
Well

I
rolled

I
find
that
rolling

saves
a

more

you
can
cram

instrumental

out
the

up

\xe2\x80\x9cthis

survived

any

I
can
handle
this

Mark
kept
asking
me
if
I
had
talked
to
Greta
about
what
the
procedure
was
going
to
be
like
\r\n
'
,
'but
I
was
kind
of
in
denial
and
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
want
to
know

figured
that
I

what
good
was
it

do\r\n

,
'
to
hear
how
much
pain
I
was
going

Fortunately
,
Allie
got
online
and
found
out
that
most
bone
marrow
transplants
done
these
days
\r\n
'
,
'does
not
involve
taking
bone
marrow
from
your
hip

'but
instead
there
was
a
new
process

bone

stems

are
taken
from

blood

\r\n

,
'It
sounded
so
much
easier

my

at

Yay

I

would
be

a
injection

the
drug
Filgrastim
every
morning
for
5
days

\r\n

increases
the
production

stem

tired

possibly
nauseous

perhaps
experience
bad
headaches

\r\n

I
might
have
the
chills
or
feel
pain
in

,
basically
any
flu-like
condition
is
a
possible
side
effect
from
the
drug

\r\n

'I
was
told
that
each
person
reacts
differently

the
drug

I
might
experience
one
,
all

these
side
effects

I
thought

\xe2\x80\x9cI

bad

it

be
sick

deal

\xe2\x80\x9d

since
I
never
had
morning
sickness
or
the
stomach
flu

rarely
get
nauseous

\r\n

'I
told
myself
that
I
was
just
going

think
positive
and
power
through
it
and
not
let
myself
get
sick
or
nauseous

The
doctors
said
the
side
effects
from
the
drug
would
probably
be
the
worst
part
of
the
process

retrieval
would

Each
morning
I

drawing
the
blood

would

,

then
the
blood
would
return

\r\n

)
I
could
have
a
pick
placed
in
my
neck
which
would
have
multiple
lines
to
retrieve
and
return
the
blood
.
\r\n
'
,
'This
was
a
tough
decision
to
make
because
the
pick
was
more
invasive
\r\n
'
,
'but
would
make
it
easier
to
unhook
the
lines
and
gave
me
the
freedom
to
move
around
,
\r\n
'
,
'get
up
and
go
to
the
bathroom
or
just
stretch
and
that
seemed
like
such
a
good
idea

I
was

to
plan

6-8
hours
each
day

that
I

experiencing

nothing

I
love
being
a
Mother
though
(
even
more
when
she\

napping
in

and
I
wouldn\'t
change
it

I
really
took
the

sleep

seriously

my

Nursing

No
one
tells
you

is
going
to
feel

you

the
local
watering
hole

The
time
in
between
feedings
goes
by
so
fast

I
sometimes
feel
like
she
is
glued
to
my
boob
for
a
good
portion
of
the

Peyton

a

Outings-
We
went
to

for
the
first
time
and
everyone
was
very
excited
to
see
the
newest
member

the
congregation

We
were
told
that
we
came
back
to
church
too
early
,

Peyton
and
I
needed
to
get
some
social
interaction

talk

Happy

''
,
'The
first
day
of
fall
might
not
be
until
the
23rd
,
but
I
decided
to
finally
be
early
on
something

a

more
fall-ish

since
it
was
still
decorated

.
Actually
,
it
was
a
mixture
of
spring
and
summer
.
But
that
is
no
excuse
,
it
looked
not-put-together
and
was
in
need
of
serious
attention
.
So
I
took
5
minutes
to
make
it
presentable.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'I
didn\'t
want
to
go
with
traditional

colors

or

I
did
the
traditional
fall
decor
last
year
,
so
I
thought
a
change
was
needed
.
This
year
I
went
with
a
neutral
color
palette
with
touches
of
warm
,
rustic
colors
.
Here
is
what
I
managed
to
rummage

'The

is
simple

which
is
a
change
for
me
.
Usually
I
really
play
it
up
with
lots

colors
and
elements
,
but
I
really
like
the
changes

On
the
left

I
staked

a
little
when
a
friend
told
me
that
I
should
sign
up
for
a
booth
at
EcoFest
,
which
I
did
.
Moment
of
madness
?
Anyways
,
I
worked
and
worked
(
and
recruited
my
parents
to
work
and
work
)
to
get
ready
.
I
had
no
clue
who
would
come

what
would
happen

I
would
even
have
anyone
enter

.
There
was
no
turning
back
though
-
I
paid
my
booth
fee
and
was
testing
the
waters
a
little
deeper
with
an

'And
you
know
what
?
The
booth
was
a
hit

Everyone
loved
the
items
,
said
the
booth
was
the
``

,
and
continually
asked
where
my
store
front
was
.
Did
you
catch
that
...
.where
is
my
store
!
I
was
over
the
moon
because
actually
hearing
the
words
from
complete
strangers
gave
me
a
huge
leap
towards
my
dream
,
not
just
a
step

That
huge
leap
is
confidence

and

so

are
happy
again
for

The

get

is

good
as

I
get
a

,
``
Have
I
traded
,
sold
or
bought
coupons
?
Absolutely
.
There
are
legal
ways
to
do
this
.
If
a
coupon
does
n't
say
non
transferrable
or
not
valid
if
sold
,
transfered
etc
...
then
it
's
not
an
issue
.
I
have
n't
couponed
much
after
having
my
youngest
and
am
just
thinking
about
starting
again
.
I
imagine
that
there
's
been
a
bit
of
a
backlash
form
Extreme
Couponing
and
I
bet
more
say
this
now
.
As
of
now
I
have
n't
even
looked
into
finding
trading
circles
.
As
for
buying
them
from
Ebay
,
it
can
be
cost
effective
if
it
's
an
item
you
know
you
will
buy
and
you
figure
in
the
cost
of
buying
the
coupons
towards
the
amount
saved
.
I
generally
tried
to
make
sure
that
I
sold
enough
to
cover
what
I
spent
buying
others
.
Which
basically
made
it
just
another
form
of
trading
.
However
,
I
currently
do
n't
even
have
a
Paypal
account
.
After
the
third
time
they
locked
the
account
up
because
someone
somewhere
tried
to
hack
into
it
a
couple
years
ago
I
never
reinstated
it
,
did
n't
feel
safe
anymore.\r\n

,
'\r\n
'
,
``
Now
as
much
as
I
dislike
Extreme
Couponing
,
I
care
even
less
for
store
managers
or
cashiers
that
give
couponers
a
hard
time
.
I
've
worked
for
a
grocery
store
in
just
about
any
position
you
can
imagine
and
several
you
probably
have
never
considered
.
So
I
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
on
this
.
It
is
just
bad
business
practice
to
hassel
a
couponer
that
is
using
coupons
in
a
valid
way
.
And
'too
many
coupons
'
or
'being
a
habitual
coupon
user
'
is
not
an
invalid
way
unless
the
coupons
actually
state
a
specific
limit
the
couponer
is
ignoring
.
I
remember
a
story
this
summer
about
a
couponer
being
refused
by
a
Kroger
store
manager
because
she
was
a
'habitual
coupon
user
'
,
just
ridiculous.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
Manufacturer
coupons
are
like
legal
tender
to
the
store
.
Giving
the
cashier
a
coupon
for
$
1.00
off
is
just
like
giving
the
cashier
a
one
dollar
bill
.
Stacking
them
with
store
coupons
is
no
different
to
the
store
then
using
the
store
coupon
alone-
and
stores
want
them
to
use
that
coupon
because
it
gets
them
in
to
the
store
to
spend
money
.
Why
should
the
store
care
if
the
money
is
the
manufacture
's
through
coupons
or
the
shopper
's
from
their
pocket
or
a
mix
of
both
?
My
experience
is
the
managers
that
have
issues
with
coupons
do
n't
understand
the
premiss
of
how
the
coupons
work
for
the
store
.
Hopefully
Kroger
Corporate
took
care
of
that
situation
.
They
at
least
should
understand
how
bad
it
is
for
the
bottom
line
of
a
store
to
refuse
money

flexibility
to
be
able

take
advantage
of
possibilities
and
to
change
our
plans
according
to
how

a

close
.
It
was
a
fitting
morning
elegy
for
the
end
of
our
Gap
Year
,
filled
with
lament
as
I
overflowed
with
emotion
.
\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'We\xe2\x80\x99d
cross-examined
ourselves
daily
over
the
previous
12
months
about
whether
taking
a
Gap
Year
was
testament
to
our
madness
,
a
tribute
to
our
pluck
or
just
a
step
in
our
lives
that
seemed
so
right
for
the
time
?
The
answer
is
likely
an
amalgam
of
all
three
.
But
whatever
the
answer
,
what
we
could
attest
to
was
feeling
lucky
.
Lucky
to
have
had
our
dream
come
true
.
Lucky
to
have
been
able
to
take
a
year
off
from
regular
life
.
And
fortunate
to
have
had
calm
waters
at
home
such
that
we
were
able
to
take
a
sabbatical
without
interruption
.
We
ran
almost
maniacally
from
the
logic
characteristic
of
some
self-satisfied
individuals
of
privilege
that
because
they\xe2\x80\x99ve
been
blessed
,
they
believe
they
deserve
it
.
We
simply
felt
lucky
,
fortunate
and
happy
that
our
madness
and
our
pluck
had
brought
us
there.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'I
recalled
the
newly
married
Filipino
couple
we\xe2\x80\x99d
met
in
Turkey
who
innocently
sought
our
advice
.
\xe2\x80\x9cIs
two
weeks
,
\xe2\x80\x9d
they
asked
,
\xe2\x80\x9cenough
time
to
see
Europe
?
\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cOh
my
,
we
replied
,
\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll
be
here
for
a
year
and
we
still
won\xe2\x80\x99t
see
it
all
.
We\xe2\x80\x99ll
barely
have
scratched
the
surface.\xe2\x80\x9d
After
353
days
,
21
countries
,
11
capital
cities
and
countless
trains
,
planes
,
busses
,
shuttles
,
rental
cars
,
cable
cars
,
gondolas
,
ships
and
ferries
,
there
was
still
so
much
more
to
see.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'As
our
plane
lifted
off
from
Orly
and
soared
upward
,
the
individual
sights
of
Paris
and
its
suburbs
quickly
blended
into
the
mosaic
of
rural
France
below
.
It
was
a
gentle
palette
of
perfectly
outlined
shapes
of
color
\xe2\x80\x93
the
soft
greens
,
tans
and
browns
of
the
countryside
.
And
as
sometimes
miraculously
happens
when
flying
to
the
US
on
a
clear
day
from
Europe
,
the
shoreline
of
coastal
France
and
then
the
outline
of
Spain
and
Portugal
appeared
far
below
as
we
headed
out
over
the
Atlantic
.
We
were
finally
heading
home.\r\n

there

'The
fantasy
had
been
with
me
for
almost
as
long
as
I
could
remember
.
I
lived
and
relived
our
European
experience
in
my
mind\xe2\x80\x99s
eye
for
over
30
years
.
The
vision
first
took
shape
when
I
was
a
young
adult
returning
from
studying
abroad
,
clarified
somewhat
and
merited
its
very
own
file
folder
as
it
remained
in
my
heart
as
I
became
a
young
mother
,
career
ladder
climber
and
dual
college
tuition
payer
and
then
blossomed
into
an
actual
,
concrete
plan
accompanied
by
spreadsheets
,
maps
and
piles
of
references
as
I
matured
into
a
middle-aged
empty
nester
.
My
id\xc3\xa9e
fixe
of
a
Gap
Year
in
Europe
with
Joe
sustained
me
through
many
a
professional
trial
,
boring
weekend
,
humid
Washington
summer
and
fleeting
vacation.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'But
now
I
find
myself
asking
,
what
will
get
me
through
those
hurdles
now
that
the
vision
has
been
realized
?
What
escapist
imaginings
will
consume
my
idle
hours
?
Will
life
be
hard
on
us
,
now
members
of
the
\xe2\x80\x9cthose
whose
dreams
have
actually
come
true\xe2\x80\x9d

?
I
was
overcome
with
difficult-to-articulate
feelings
as
we
prepared
to
go
home.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'As
a
child
I
watched
a
Hayley
mills
movie
,
The
Moon
Spinners
,
in
which
she
and
her
friends
get
into
mischievous
escapades
on
Greek
hillsides
dotted
with
windmills
and
the
seed
for
seeing
the
world
was
sown
.
I
read
Rebecca
,
The
Sun
also
Rises
,
The
Talented
Mr.
Ripley
,
The
Sheltering
Sky
and
The
Drifters
.
They
filled
me
with
longing
for
adventure
in
other
countries
and
the
reverie
of
some
day
living
abroad.\r\n

'\r\n

'At
every
opportunity

pennies

the
family
budget

work
schedules
allowed

Joe

I
took
off
for
Europe

visiting
my
beloved
France

also
venturing
to
England

Scotland

heading
all
the
way
south
to
Crete

We
traveled
with
each
other
for
international
business
conferences
and
made
special
anniversary
trips
for
our
15th
,
20th
and
25th
celebrations
.
But
as
lovely
and
exciting
as
these
voyages
were
,
they
were
short-lived
and
temporary
.
But
we
were
determined
not
to
relegate
living
in
Europe
to
the
outer
reefs
of
\xe2\x80\x9csomeday
isle\xe2\x80\x9d

with
all
those
other
resolutions
:
someday
I\xe2\x80\x99ll

it
was

time

'We
would
soon
be
back

grind

in
the
clutches

the
Washington
Beltway
bourgeoisie

subject
to
the
incessant
drumbeat
of
our
modern

I
could
see
the
stresses
lurking
just
beyond
the
horizon
back
in
the
States
,
ready
to
pounce
the
moment
we
arrived

Anything
related
to
finding
new
employment
and
heading
back
to
the
frenzied
reality
of
daily
life
made
me
anxious
and
prone
to
procrastination

We
were
resolute
,
however

about
doing
our
best
to
resist
the
pressures
and
remain
dispassionate
about
the
day-to-day

'Thirty-one
years
after
initially
setting
up
housekeeping
together

I
thought
about
what
a
gift
we\xe2\x80\x99d
been
handed
:
to
once
again
start
our
lives
anew
.
World-weary
travelers

I
knew
we
would
delight
in
settling
down
,
being
rooted
in
the
comfortable
and
mundane
and
anxious
to
loose
ourselves
in
new
routines
,
untested
and
pregnant
with
possibility
.
Yes
,
we
would
get
to
begin
again
with
no
idea
of
where
we
would
work
or
where
we
would
live
.
We
would
have
the
ability
to
reinvent
ourselves
and
our
lives
and
play
a
whole
new
hand
of
cards
.
Life
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
get
much
luckier
than
that.\r\n

we\xe2\x80\x99re
certain

foreign

back

We\xe2\x80\x99ll
have
to
get
used

reading
signs
in
English

adjust
to
the
daily
visual
parade
of

morbidly
obese

loud

badly

there
a
new
person

off

Perhaps
I
won\xe2\x80\x99t

the
answer
until
we\xe2\x80\x99re
back
in
the
melee
and
I
see
how
I
deal
with
the
everyday
.
But
I
experienced
some
revelations
while
we
were
away
and
chief
among
them
is
the
reinforcement
of
the
virtues
of
simplicity
and
kindness
.
There
were
times
while
traveling
when
we
had
an
acute
need
for
a
kind
gesture
--
just
a
little
one
.
And
when
it
materialized
in
the
form
of
a
clerk\xe2\x80\x99s

a

thing
in

to

The
hubby
had
suggested
tile

I
was
adamant
that
I
did
NOT
want
tile

Nothing
against
it

it
just
wasn\'t
the
look
I
was

for

But
then
,
the
night
after
he
suggested
it
,
I
had
an
epiphany
!
I
thought
,
why
not
use
wood
look
tile
!
Tile
is
so
easy
and
durable
,
not
to
mention
cheaper
than
anything
else
,
and
the
wood
look
tile
is
beautiful.\r\n

I

Red
is

Taylor

After
almost
all
of
her
shows
,
Taylor
has
a
Club
Red
.
Club
Red
is
basically
a
meet
and
greet
but
it
lasts
a
little
longer
and
only
a
select
few
are
chosen
from
the
crowd
.
Inside
Club
Red
there
is
pizza
,
Cokes
,
candy
,
and
several
of
her
costumes
are
displayed
from
previous
tours
.
About
20
to
25
people
are
chosen
for
each
show
.
You
are
chosen
from
the
crowd
by
Taylor
's
mom
,
Andrea
,
or
someone
working
with
her
.
You
can
be
chosen
for
many
different
reasons
but
being
a
crazy
fan
is
helpful
.
And
,
apparently
,
it
does
n't
matter
where
you
are
seated

we
were
at

very
top

were
still
chosen

By
this
point
I
had
quit
thinking
about
Club
Red
and
was
enjoying
the
concert
.
This
lady
came
up
to
us
and
was
talking
to
mom
so
I
leaned
in
to
see
what
was
going
on
.
Neither
of
us
could
hear
her
at
all
so
I
just
smiled
and
said
,
``
yes
''
.
You
know
,
the
way
you
do
when
you
have
no
clue
what
someone
is
saying
.
I
thought
she
was
asking
to
get
by
or
something
.
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Then
I
heard
her
say
the
magical
words
,
``
You
are
going
to
meet
Taylor
after
the
show
!
''
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
Y'all.\n
''
,
'Que
the
hysteria
.
I
was
a
mess
.
\n
'
,
'I
started
crying
immediately
,
put
my
hand
over
my
mouth
,
and
shook
my
head
in
disbelief
for
a
long
time
.
I
remember
looking
at
my
mom
,
telling
her
we
got
to
meet
Taylor
after
the
show
and
mom
saying
,
``
Ohh
,
Whitney\
's
gon
na
cry
!
``
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'Damn
straight
I
was
going
to
cry.\n
'
,
'
I
had
been
thinking
about
this
moment
for
quite
awhile
,
reading
other
people\
's
stories
about
getting
into
Club
Red
,
and
looking
at
their
pictures
in
envy
.
I
couldn\'t
,
and
still
can\'t
,
believe
that
we
were
chosen
!
Out
of
12,000
people
,
we
were
picked
!
It
was
the
most
excited
I
have
ever
felt

has
it
on

I
have

to

was
crazy

me

The
Lucky
One
was
only
the
5th
song
,
so
we
still
had
quite
some
time
to
enjoy
the
concert
.
I
wonder
if
they
did
that
on
purpose

choosing
us
during
The
Lucky
One
?
I
remember
my
mom
saying
,

We
did
some
cold

yesterday
(
along
with
half
the

We
threw
boiling
water
in
the

what
happened

cool

not

We
tried
blowing
bubbles
to

them
freeze
(
most
popped
before
they
froze
)
.
We
had
friends
who
froze
a
t-shirt
and
broke
it
in
half
and
who
played
ice-bowling
.
It\
's
too
cold
to

it\

fine

I

we

in

future
.
So
here
I
am
again.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
I
discovered
a
book
called
Framed
by
Frank
Cottrell
Boyce
.
If
you
saw
the
movie
Millions
,
he
's
the
guy
who
wrote
it
(
well
,
first
he
wrote
the
book
,
then
the
movie
came
along
)
.
On
a
whim
,
I
checked
the
CDs
out
from
the
library
.
We
loved
it
.
We
ended
up
checking
out
all
the
books
on
CD
by
Frank
Cottrell
Boyce
that
our
library
system
carried
:
Cosmic
and
The
Unforgettable
Coat
.
While
not
necessarily
for
younger
listeners
,
we
enjoyed
them
--
probably
because
each
was
read
by
a
voice
actor
with
a
superb
British
accent.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
'The
boys
have
also
been
enjoying
The
Sisters
Grimm
series
by
Michael
Buckley
.
Again
,
not
necessarily
for
younger
listeners
,
it
involves
two
orphaned
girls
who
have
been
through
several
bad
foster
situations
only
to
find
themselves
placed
with
a
grandmother
whom
their
father
said
was
dead
.
She
claims
they
are
descendents
of
the
Brothers
Grimm
and
that
their
family
has
been
recording
and
protecting
fairy-tale
history
for
years
.
The
stories
involve
your
classic
fairy
tale
characters
who
are
now
living
in
a
secluded
village
in
New
York
state
where
the
Grimm
family
has
vowed
to
maintain
order
and
protect
the
outside
world
from
magic
and
mischief.\n

Not
that
we
have

in

all

been
practicing

well

in

later.\n

'The
Birthday
Sleepover\n
'
,
``
Our
oldest
son
turns
9
tomorrow
.
In
the
past
we
've
let
them
invite
one
friend
for
each
year
of
age
.
Last
year
he
invited
8
friends
over
.
This
year
,
since
he
's
getting
bigger
,
we
gave
the
option
of
having
a
sleepover
.
We
mutually
decided
that
two
friends
was
a
good
start
for
the
first
non-family
sleepover.\n
''
,
'\n
'
,
'We
did
it
simple
and
low-key
,
but
I
think
everyone
had
fun
(
except
for
the
friend
who
was
homesick
and
went
home
before
anyone
was
asleep
,
but
he
knew
coming
into
the
party
that
he
would
have
a
hard
time
staying
away
from
home
--
and
he
had
fun
except
for
bed-time
)
.
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
``
Personally
,
I
think
a
lot
of
birthday
parties
have
gotten
out
of
control
.
It
's
great
to
celebrate
and
have
fun
,
but
we
're
not
going
to
spend
a
few
hundred
dollars
on
a
party
.
And
we
find
that
we
do
n't
need
to
in
order
for
the
boys
to
feel
celebrated
on
their
birthdays
.
They
mainly
want
to
hang
out
with
friends
anyway
(
okay
,
maybe
open
some
presents
,
too
)

we

we

By

just

wet

Then
Laura
and
Svet
claimed
they
needed
to
get
going
and
left
right
after
dinner
was
over
.
Shortly
after
Fernando
and
I
went
on
our
way
with
(
what
I
thought
was
)
our
plans
for
dessert
.
Nonno
and
Nonna
stayed
to
babysit
the
girls
and
we
headed
out
.
\n

'When
we
got
in

told

all
the
way
to

destination
.
He
said
he
wanted
the
dessert
place
we
were
going
to
be
a
surprise
.
At
this
point
I
still
wasn\'t
suspicious
.
This
is
the
kind
of
stuff
Fernando
does
randomly
so
I
definitely
didn\'t
think
it
was
a
surprise
party
!

'When
we
pulled
up
to

said

I
knew
something
was
up

It
was
obvious
he
pulled
into
a
driveway

not

Then
he
opened
up
a

was

had

some

at
1pm

She

up
with

go
enjoy
my

handed
me
10
bucks

this

then
another
10

the
requirements
for

week

I
am
still
a
little
old

overbooked

there
is
something
to
be
said

having
it
all
written
out
so
you
can
see
the
week
in
a
glance
and
really
see
any
gaps
in
the
schedule
.
Our
biggest
issue
that
now
we
have
the
triplets
doing
activities
.
If
everyone
has
an
event
on
a
single
night
I
am
just
out
of
people
.
It
takes
some
patience
and
the
ability
to
ask
for
help
to
be
able
to
juggle
and
balance
this
interesting
6
week
time
period
in
the
spring
.
Liam
plays
baseball
and
the
triplets
also
play
baseball
.
Eamon
and
Liam
play
spring
hockey
.
Mairin
does
swim
and
tennis
.
Eamon
and
Liam
also
participate
in
the
7th
grade
tennis
team
thru
school
.
Some
of
the
frustration
comes
with
the
overlapping
of
the
seasons
.
Baseball
is
wrapping
up
and
swim
tune
up
is
beginning
.
Spring
hockey
is
ending
but
tennis
has
another
week
.

Monday
night
we
had
an
amazing
experience

Our
church
hosts
35
homeless
people
from
the
South
Oakland
Homeless
Shelter
every
year
for
a
week
.
We
provide
the
food
for
3
meals
a
day
.
They
sleep
at
the
our
parish
and
we
provide
everything
they
need
.
Our
parish
volunteers
to
take
the
people
to
their
jobs
,
schools
or
to
the
shelters
during
the
day
and
they
all
come
back
in
the
evenings
.
We
decided
to
take
on
the
dinner
for
Monday
evening
.
I
grabbed
4
other
families
from
our
parish
and
we
got
together
to
make
a
taco
night
with
all
the
fixings
.
The
mom
's
made
the
food
but
the
kids
all
served
the
dinner
,
helped
clean
up
and
then
entertained
the
kids
for
the
evening
.
It
was
so
enjoyable
for
all
of
us
and
definitely
something
we
will
do
again
in
the
future.\n

The

Family

'Easter
is
always
interesting
.
Our
church
is
never
full
enough
to
where
you
can\xe2\x80\x99t
find
a
seat
but
on
Easter
you
have
to
make
sure
and
get
there
early
in
order
to
grab
a
seat
.
This
is
especially
true
for
us
because
the
8
of
us
take
up
an
entire
row
.
The
holidays
(
no
matter
which
one
it
is
)
is
always
exhausting
because
the
amount
of
work
that
goes
into
getting
everyone
dressed

ready
in
their
fancy
clothes
is
quite
an
undertaking

'The
Spring
Dance\n
'
,
'The
snow
is
melting
and
everything
here
in
Michigan
is
looking
grey
and
very
drab
.
Spring
is
around
the
corner
but
if
you
look
outside
you
just
can\xe2\x80\x99t
believe
that
it
is
close
.
The
only
way
to
really
begin
anticipating
spring
is
to
see
all
the
spring
goods
in
the
stores
and
take
advantage
of
the
increased
hours
of
daylight
.
Kids
are
starting
their
baseball
season
and
everyone
is
scheduling
around
March
Madness
.
It
is
time
for
all
of
the
spring
sports
to
begin
and
for
those
of
us
hockey
families
,
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
Spring
Dance
.
You
would
not
understand
it
if
you
didn\xe2\x80\x99t
experience
it
.
You
probably
won\xe2\x80\x99t
believe
me
when
I
explain
it
.
Those
of
you
reading
who
are
in
hockey
will
get
it
and
those
of
you
who
are
not
will
question
why
in
the
heck
do
you
participate
in
such
craziness
.
My
husband
calls
it
the
Spring
Dance
and
I
think
it
is
a
very
fitting
name
for
what
is
about
to
occur.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'We
dedicate
ourselves
to
a
season
of
hockey
that
runs
August
through
March
.
We
become
friends
with
the
other
parents
on
our
team
because
we
spend
more
time
together
than
we
do
with
anyone
else
.
We
are
on
the
ice
3
days
a
week
and
often
will
add
a
game
or
conditioning
session
in
there
somewhere
.
We
all
sit
together
and
cheer
on
our
boys
.
It
doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
take
long
to
know
each
kid
and
know
how
they
skate
and
what
their
number
is
.
You
start
to
cheer
on
all
the
kids
on
your
team
and
celebrate
their
victories
as
if
they
are
all
your
own
children
.
Your
heart
drops
when
one
gets
injured
and
you
feel
like
it
is
your
own
.
You
spend
weekends
together
either
in
hotels
or
locally
waiting
for
the
games
to
start
.
Some
rinks
stink
and
leak
and
some
are
wonderful
.
We
enjoy
finding
restaurants
that
will
take
a
reservation
for
40
after
a
tournament
game
.
I
have
witnessed
hide
and
go
seek
in
Meijers
(
just
to
kill
some
time
in
between
games
)
,
skating
parties
on

or
other
man
made
arenas
in
backyards
.
I
have
watched
12
year
old
boys
say
dumb
things
and
make
messes
while
showing
off
in
front
of
their
friends
at
a
hockey
dinner
.
I
have
carpooled
with
different
families
and
have
visited
many
team
members
homes
for
team
gatherings
.
My
boys
have
made
so
many
friends
throughout
the
years
of
hockey
and
we
have
learned
to
never
burn
a
bridge
as
you
will
probably
share
a
team
with
that
person
again
in
the
future
.

'We
never
dreamed
we
would
be
a
hockey
family
.
We
never
played
hockey
and
we
really
never
had
friends
who
played
.
All
it
took
was
a
neighbor
who
had
a
son
6
years
older
than
my
oldest
who
asked
if
they
could
use

one
winter
8
years
ago
.
The
boys
put
on
their

watched
the

it
was

They
learned
to

and
wanted
more
.
We
started
with
a
tot
hockey
program
and
proceeded
to
play
house
for
2
years
.
The
boys
improved
and
we
decided
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
crazy
people
and
dove
into
a
\xe2\x80\x9cbeginner
travel
team\xe2\x80\x9d
.
By
beginner
I
mean
\xe2\x80\x9ca
glorified
house
team
with
more
ice
time\xe2\x80\x9d
.
We
never
traveled
very
far
and
the
cost
was
reasonable
.
Most
of
all
the
boys
loved
it
.
They
always
kept
excellent
grades
and
never
ever
complained
about
an
early
practice
or
having
to
miss
something
because
of
hockey
.
They
love
it
,
they
crave
it
and
they
want
more
of
it
.
Eamon
always
says
,
\xe2\x80\x9cthere

nothing

than

'Let\xe2\x80\x99s
talk
more
about
the
dance
.
The
season
often
ends
mid
March
and
it
is
not
a
week
later
that
tryouts
are
upon
us
.
The
spring
hockey
season
is
short..about
6
to
8
weeks
.
It
can
be
a
critical
time
to
make
moves
because
you
can
better
secure
your
fall
spot
if
you
choose
that
team
in
the
spring
.
You
will
see
talent
move
from
one
team
to
another
year
after
year
.
I
once
heard
a
coach
say
that
the
best
part
of
hockey
was
the
end
of
the
season
when
the
coaches
would
fight
and
steal
kids
and
the
mystery
and
anticipation
of
what
team
will
end
up
being
the
best
.
Spring
is
the
only
time
you
can
double
roster
and
the
coaches
carry
bigger
teams
.
You
could
also
call
it
an
extended
tryout
.
End
of
February
and
beginning
of
March
is
when
everyone
shuts
down
.
People
don\xe2\x80\x99t
talk
about
what
they
are
going
to
do
.
There
is
no
talk
of
staying
on
the
team
or
leaving
.
The
funny
part
is
that
most
people
won\xe2\x80\x99t
ask
others
what
they
are
doing
either
.
It
is
a
very
weird
secret
time
in
the
hockey
world
.
This
is
when
teams
can
fall
apart
.
There
are
times
when
groups
get
together
and
will
all
leave
together..secretly
.
There
is
also
lots
of
talk
about
who
is
at
tryouts
.
You
could
happen
to
run
into
someone
at
a
tryout
who
is
on
your
team
and
it
is
usually
an
awkward
moment
.
People
will
often
talk
about
who
they
saw
at
another
tryout
and
everyone
is
always
at
tryouts
to
see
who
is
showing
up
.
\xe2\x80\x9cIs
there
any
new
talent
coming
to
our
tryouts\xe2\x80\x9d
is
a
common
question
among
the
men
folk
.
You
will
see
a
cluster
of
dads
standing
around
acting
like
they
have
to
be
there
for
their
kids
tryout
but
secretly
none
of
them
let
their
wives
take
the
kids
because
this
is
like
a
prime
time
social
event
,
a
presidential
ball
where
your
child
is
being
presented
on
the
ice
and
everyone
is
watching
.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t
let
any
dad
fool
you
that
they
are
not
reliving
their
childhood
and
experiencing
an
adrenaline
rush
just
being
there
for
their
kids
.
\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'After
try
outs
everyone
goes
about
their
business
and
it
is
only
until
all
the
tryouts
are
closed
and
the
rosters
are
posted
do
you
really
know
what
people
are
doing
.
Every
year
we
are
usually
blown
away
with
some
of
the
moves
but
I
guess
this
is
part
of
the
game
of
hockey
.
This
is
the
part
that
stresses
me
out
the
most
.
Some
years
we
spend
time
deciding
what
to
do
and
some
years
we
don\xe2\x80\x99t
try
out
for
any
teams
other
than
our
current
one
.
This
year
was
the
year
we
chose
to
entertain
some
tryouts
.
It
brought
back
the
stress
and
the
anxiety

The
little\xe2\x80\x99s
are
getting
older
and
they
are
now
doing
their
own
sports
and
we
were
playing
on
a
team
that
was
a
solid
30
minutes
away
.
We
have
2
teams
that
are
literally

and
we
wanted
to
check
them
out
.
Spring
is
by
far
,
the
craziest
time
of
the
year
for
my
family
and
requires
David
and
me
to
coordinate
schedules
and
be
on
our
A
game
.
I
have
recently
added
all
the
upcoming
events
to

and
have
realized
that
I
will
have
to
enlist
a
fellow
driver
to
help
us
out
this
year
.
There
are
too
many
evenings
when
we
have
3
places
to
be.\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'\n
'
,
'In
the
end
after
several
weeks
of
trying
out
and
talking
about
things
we
decided
that
we
will
be
making
a
move
for
spring
to
a
team
that
might
(
and
I
stress
might
)
be
a
little
bit
better
than
our
current
team
and
it
is
for
sure
a
lot
closer
(
11
minutes
away
)
.
We
did
the
dance
this
year
.
We
made
our
commitment
this
past
Sunday
to
a
new
team
and
although
we
disappointed
some
people
and
surprised
others
we
are
happy
with
our
decision
because
it
was
right
for
our
family
.

a

two
months
into

I

therapeutic

Oddly
enough
,
I
've
been
to
very
few
weddings
.
A
lot
of
people
complain
about
weddings
,
like
they
're
a
drag
or
something
.
I
love
them
.
I
love
looking
at
all
of
the
people
,
watching
the
families
interact
,
figuring
out
who
knows
whom
,
who
tolerates
whom
,
you
get
the
idea
.
I
love
to
watch
the
eccentric
great
aunt
with
her
shaky
,
little
hands
,
clutching
her
champagne
glass
smeared
with
red
lipstick
smudges
around
the
rim
and
crumbs
of
God
knows
what
permanently
lodged
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
.
I
love
the
awkward
little
children
,
dressed
up
like
adults
,
the
boys
looking
miserable
and
uncomfortable
and
the
girls
loving
their
princess
hair
and
dresses
and
all
of
the
attention
.
I
love
watching
the
bride
's
second
cousin
flirting
with
the
groom
's
best
man
's
brother
,
and
sneaking
off
to
hook
up
after
just
enough
champagne
,
wine
and
cocktails
to
chalk
it
up
to
'weddings'.\r\n

'\r\n

``
I
love
the
formality
,
the
process

I
love
watching
the
groom
's
face
,
and
see
his
eyes
light
up
(
or
fill
with
tears
)
when
he
first
lays
eyes
on
his
very
soon-to-be-bride
walking
down
the
aisle
toward
him
.
And
,
at
that
moment
,
I
always
cry
a
little
.
I
love
how
awkward
they
are
.
I
love
that
as
a
result
of
how
awkward
they
are
,
and
how
no
one
really
knows
anyone
all
that
well
,
no
one
is
really
themselves
;
rather
people
take
on
a
veil
of
anonymity
.
And
pretty
much
everyone
over
indulges
in
some
way
or
another.\r\n

I
love

either

the

'It
had
been
at
least
five
years
since
my
last
wedding
,
until
this
past
weekend
.
One
of
my
clients
was
getting
married
.
And
she
wanted
her
dog
,
Giovanni
,
to
be
in
the
wedding
.
To
be
specific
,
she
wanted
me
to
escort
Giovanni
to
the
wedding
and
make
sure
he
made
it
down
the
aisle
with
his
``
grandfather
''
(
the
bride\
's
dad
)
.
An
ordinary
day
.
Giovanni
is
an
awesome
dog
and
I
adore
him
.
Giovanni
is
a
Pug
.
It
was
a
hot
day
:
Giovanni
mouth
breathes
like
a
Pug
,
is
a
tiny
bit
chubby
,
and
does
not
love
the
heat.\r\n

planners\

instructions

Giovanni
downtown
at
five
pm
and
parked
outside
the
venue
.
We
were
escorted
in
by
one
of
the
planners
;
I
then
waited
to
hand
him
off
to
the
bride\
's
father
at
the
proper
time
.
Oh
,
did
I
mention
Giovanni
was
wearing
a
tuxedo
?
A
snug
tux
at
that
--
couldn\'t
fasten
the
bottom
button
.
So
here
I
am
in
downtown
LA
at
5
pm
on
what
seemed
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
with
a
chubby
Pug
in
a
tux
.
After
Giovanni\
's
down
the
aisle
promenade
with
granddad
I
was
to
take
him
and
wait
until
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
at
which
point
the
wedding
photographer
was
going
to
get
a
few
shots
of
the
happy
couple
with
Giovanni
.
Then
Gio
and
I
were
free
to
go.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
Everything
went
as
planned
.
Except
there
were
no
side
aisles
.
So
for
the
first
few
moments
of
the
ceremony
,
I
sat
in
the
very
front
row
,
next
to
the
VIPs
and
the
parents
,
who
must
have
wondered
who
this
bold
stranger
might
be
.
I
quietly
explained
,
\xe2\x80\x9cI
'm
the
dog
walker\xe2\x80\x9d
,
and
they
seemed
relieved
.
So
,
Gio
's
granddad
walked
his
daughter
and
her
dog
down
the
aisle
and
it
was
touching
.
As
always
,
while
everyone
else
was
craning
their
necks
to
catch
that
first
glimpse
of
the
bride
,
I
watched
the
groom
's
face
,
and
could
tell
exactly
when
he
laid
eyes
on
her
,
in
her
dress
,
for
the
first
time
.
And
I
cried
a
little.\r\n

After
that
,
Giovanni
was
quickly
handed
to
me
and
,
while
the
ceremony
began
to
hit
its
stride
,
I
had
to
awkwardly
duck
back
up
the
center
aisle
,
the
only
aisle
.
The
very
aisle
that
still
had
the
lingering
scent
of
the
bride
's
perfume
as
she
had
just
walked
down
it
not
six
seconds
prior
.
And
,
of
course
,
with
Giovanni
panting
very
audibly
in
his
tuxedo
.
A
graceful
exit
it
was
not.\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
'Then
,
Gio
and
I
were
shown
to
a
corner
in
the
back
of
the
reception
area
to
wait
for
the
ceremony
to
end
.
A
couple
of
the
caterers
and
staff
were
curious
about
what
we
were
doing
back
there
,
all
alone
,
no
champagne
.
\xe2\x80\x9cI\
'm
the
dog
walker
,
''
I
told
them.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
``
Then
,
as
fast
as
it
began
,
it
was
over
.
And
while
Giovanni
was
photographed
with
his
just
married
mom
and
dad
,
I
waited
by
the
front
door
of
the
venue
with
the
valets
.
Then
a
woman
stepped
outside
for
some
air
and
since
we
were
the
only
non-valets
standing
there
,
she
felt
compelled
to
say
,
\xe2\x80\x9cHi
,
I
'm
Evelyn
,
the
groom
's
sister
.
Are
you
with
bride
or
groom
?
\xe2\x80\x9d
To
which
I
confidently
replied
,
\xe2\x80\x9cHi
,
I
'm
the
dog
walker
!
\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n
''
,
'\r\n
'
,
'And
so
,
as
the
bride
and
groom
went
back
inside
to
enjoy
the
reception
,
the
meal
,
the
dancing
and
the
champagne
with
all
of
their
family
and
friends

Giovanni

project

making
ricotta

was
something
I
had
wanted
to
do
for
a
very
long
time
\xe2\x80\x93
ever
since
I
saw
the

,
I
told
him
about
how
it
felt
so
strange
to
have
been
a
part
,
in
even
the
tiniest
way
,
of
one
of
the
most
important
days
in
two
people\
's
lives
,
but
to
have
been
so
very
invisible
.
I
wasn\'t
really
even
there
.
And
I
didn\'t
mind
one
bit
\xe2\x80\x93
though
a
glass
of
champagne
would
have
been
much
appreciated.\r\n
'
,
'\r\n
'
,
'As
we
sat
down
to
the

our
dinner
of
grilled
pork
tenderloin
(
with
an
amazing
dry
rub
)
and
zucchini
with
Ni\xc3\xa7oise
olives
and
homemade
ricotta
,
I
realized
I
definitely
got
my
wedding
fix
.
I
got
the
vibe
.
I
watched
the
families
,
the
couples
,
the
singles
scoping
out
their
next
flirt
target
.
There
was
champagne
,
and
spicy
margaritas
.
It
was
a
taco
theme
,
with
mariachis
and
the
whole
bit
.
I
did
what
most
women
who
have
not
yet
had
their
own
wedding
do
(
and
have
thought
about
since
they
were
six
years
old
)
,
compare
it
to
what
they
would
do
differently
,
take
note
of
what
worked
,
little
details
,
d\xc3\xa9cor
,
style
,
all
of
it
.
And
before
Giovanni
and
I
left
,
I
did
get
a
hug
from
the
bride
and
groom
\xe2\x80\x93
which
is
actually
pretty
hard
to
get
at
a
lot
of
weddings
,
with
all
of
the
hullabaloo
.
Especially
for
the
dog
walker
