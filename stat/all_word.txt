travel
is
to
take
a
journey
into
yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x93
is
my
sixth
life
is
it
seventh
we
move
to
a
new
city
especially
if
it\xe2\x80\x99s
abroad
it
often
feels
like
we
started
living
a
completely
new
life
we
are
a
different
person
compared
to
the
one
that
left
home
home
.\r\n
in
a
foreign
place
feels
much
different
than
going
there
as
a
tourist
a
tourist
it
seems
much
harder
to
experience
the
way
the
foreign
culture
breaths
and
it\xe2\x80\x99s
much
harder
to
find
the
nooks
and
crannies
which
locals
are
well
aware
of
immersing
myself
in
another
culture
was
a
worthwhile
mind
expanding
experience.\r\n
asked
myself
why
that
is
what
happens
when
we
move
to
a
new
city
\r\n
get
shocked
out
of
our
minds.\r\n
could
not
have
imagined
a
scene
like
this
in
my
wildest
dreams
even
though
we\xe2\x80\x99ve
all
heard
stories
of
how
liberal
people
are
imagine
a
coffee
shop
in
which
one
could
enjoy
cannabis
is
placed
in
the
heart
of
city
right
next
to
a
church
which
is
sitting
comfortably
next
to
famous
red
light
district
filled
with
ladies
of
the
night
seductively
trying
to
beckon
you
over
all
the
while
kids
are
walking
about
the
premises
minding
their
own
business.\r\n
something
so
far
out
of
what
my
surroundings
taught
me
right
has
shocked
me
and
made
me
smile
at
the
same
time
helped
me
grow
because
realized
that
nothing
is
inherently
good
or
bad
it\xe2\x80\x99s
only
our
perceptions
that
make
it
so.\r\n
mind
was
also
blown
during
the
first
few
encounters
with
traffic
which
made
me
feel
like
was
the
frog
from
the
classic
arcade
game.\r\n
shocked
out
of
our
minds
is
eye
opening
for
a
few
reasons
\r\n
'1
live
in
the
moment
much
more
often
without
even
trying
am
shocked
have
no
time
to
think
experiences
tend
to
do
that
to
all
of
us
\r\n
'2
learn
about
ourselves
by
finding
new
personal
limits
we
might
have
never
thought
were
there
then
we
break
them
and
our
comfort
zone
expands
never
thought
might
be
uncomfortable
to
see
children
near
prostitutes
but
it
did
stick
out
in
my
mind.\r\n
'3
experiences
like
these
we
get
to
see
the
world
with
a
new
refined
set
of
eyes
this
is
excellent
because
as
put
it
\xe2\x80\x9cwhen
you
change
the
way
you
look
at
things
the
things
you
look
at
change\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n
'4
the
things
we
fear
increases
confidence
as
suggested
by
great
way
to
ground
ourselves
during
these
changes
in
the
way
we
view
life
is
to
meditate
least
it
helped
me
tremendously.\r\n
'
get
to
reinvent
ourselves.\r\n
'
moved
to
which
my
first
city
away
from
home
home
it
felt
like
could
finally
get
rid
of
the
expectations
everyone
in
my
environment
had
of
me.\r\n
'
biggest
obstacle
to
change
are
often
the
people
closest
to
us
as
we
are
afraid
of
disappointing
them
much
easier
not
to
bother
with
what
people
will
think
now
but
back
then
it
felt
terrifyingly
uncomfortable
to
do
something
my
parents
or
my
friends
did
not
expect
of
me.\r\n
'
a
new
city
we
almost
get
to
start
our
lives
over
makes
replacing
old
habits
with
new
ones
seem
easy
fact
we
have
to
make
new
habits
as
everything
is
new
for
us.\r\n
best
habit
picked
up
after
my
move
to
is
to
walk
for
at
least
two
hours
a
day
and
haven\xe2\x80\x99t
dropped
it
since
allows
me
to
get
to
know
the
city
am
in
much
better
it\xe2\x80\x99s
a
good
exercise
and
it\xe2\x80\x99s
also
a
form
of
a
meditative
practice.\r\n
changes
that
happen
within
us
once
we
move
cities
can
be
so
powerful
that
often
remember
the
past
not
by
year
but
by
place
lived
in
at
that
moment
in
time
feels
like
led
completely
different
lives
\xe2\x80\x93
just
hope
that
have
more
lives
than
cats
do
because
close
to
nine
\r\n
learn
that
people
everywhere
are
people
just
like
us.\r\n

worked
in
a

in
during
my
stay

from
in
search
of
a
better
life.\r\n

his
monthly
salary
every
year
about
eight
years
he\xe2\x80\x99s
worked
at
the
hostel
he
got
to
go
home
to
where
he
could
see
his
children
only
twice
now
his
wife
is
also
working
in
but
he
told
me
they
only
get
to
see
each
other
for
a
little
bit
every
few
days
at
his
workplace.\r\n
'
knew
his
situation
was
less
than
ideal
but
instead
of
letting
it
all
get
him
down
he
spoke
with
great
vigor
of
his
plans
to
open
up
a
business
back
in
'
realized
we
had
much
more
in
common
than
it
seemed
at
first
glance
hopes
and
dreams
are
not
much
different
than
mine
nor
is
his
struggle
to
materialize
them
he
had
a
much
more
difficult
starting
position
in
this
life
than
did
to
be
honest
wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t
be
too
keen
to
trade
places
with
him.\r\n
find
happiness
in
unexpected
places.\r\n
