
I never thought that I would enjoy running as much as I do. I never really thought that I see my love of <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>riding</object>[a] wane. But both of those things seem to have happened.
Right now, I don’t have a “Next Challenge”[b]. The Iditarod Trail Invitational in February (story to appear in the next Sidetracked Magazine) and the Yukon 1000 in July were fantastic, but costly. Having recently moving <object value=”house” id=”1” type=”perm”>house</object> (and had the standard shafting from the bank), I’m pretty cleaned out financially. So there is no next adventure (yet).
It was always “easy” to train for <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>bike</object> adventures because I loved <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>riding</object>. Sometimes it was difficult to get out of the door and onto the <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>bike</object>. Sometimes it sucked to put on my wet shoes, or hose down my clothes [c][d]in the dark and the rain. But I always knew that, not long into the <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>ride</object>, the outright fun of <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>riding</object> <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>bikes</object> would make it all better. Now, though, the faff and the expense seem to outweigh the outright fun.
It’s not time to sell all the <object value = “bike” id=”0” type=”perm”> bikes </object>[e][f] and sack it all off, but it is time to do what seems like the most fun. Pursue the kind of drives that made mountain <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>biking</object> so much fun in the first place: getting outdoors, pushing yourself, having those shared secret moments of boundless enjoyment in your own little world.
So paddling (canoe and sea kayak, mainly), climbing, and running seem pretty legit.[g] All activities that I have been unable to commit to in the past, due to <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>riding</object>. Now’s the time to see what they can offer when I give them the time and effort to reap their rewards.
Which is why I ended up setting out on Trentishoe Down this morning to run a section of the Southwest Coast Path. Regular running with the <object value=”dog” id=”5” type=”perm”>dog</object> had got me the fitness, now it was time to go on a more adventurous trip. (Note: <object value=”dog” id=”5” type=”perm”>Anuk</object>[h] is awesome, see here. But he has a cut on his paw, so he’s off running for a few days)
In the <object value=”car” id=”6” type=”perm”>car</object>, moments before setting out, I felt the nervousness and uncertainty that had accompanied early mountain <object value=”bike” id=”0” type=”perm”>bike rides</object>. Could I really make this run? What if things went wrong? It seems cold out. One use for my experience of other adventures is that I know which of these thoughts to listen to: at that moment, none of them needed to be listened to.
The wind was blowing hard, chilling me before I had had chance to warm up. The rolling green hills of the approach to the coastal path were lost on me. I was keen to be moving, and be warm. I wanted to start ticking off distance so that this would feel more real. Almost immediately, I was sliding around in the mud. Aforementioned financial reasons (and knowing nearby bits of the path to be gravelly rather than muddy) meant that I was running in my regular <object value=”road shoes” id=”7” type=”perm”> road shoes </object>. I trotted. If I were riding a bike the way I was running, I’d be that guy with both brakes on hard.[i] Limbs all tense. Probably dragging a skid the whole way down the descent. As the trail flattened and did turn more to gravel, I could appreciate the cliffs laid out ahead of me. It was a special place and it was mine.[j] This was simple, it was flow and smell and sound and being. The morning sun was still too low to reach much of the path, but when I turned up Heddon’s Mouth Cleave, it lit the mist and bracken with gold.
Coming down steep steps and across some scree, I thought back to the runner I had seen on Ben Nevis years back. I did not resemble them, but maybe one day I could. The low-down woods and the babble of the river were a different, quieter world. They were warm and inviting. Some easy going on the flat to stretch out my stride again.
Climbing out was remarkably like climbing on a singlespeed.[k] No way to make it easier, just tap it out like the top is 100 miles away. Hard, but sustained effort. Sun tipping onto a few outcrops and Wales sitting in the far distance.
This was cool. This would actually be fun to ride. But on a bike[l], the drop to Woody Bay would be over in a flash. On foot, I try to read a mosaic of leaf, rock and root. It was fine, fleet, going.
Coming out at the water’s edge, I felt good. But I had just been going downhill for nearly a mile.
Reassured that I was going to finish my planned route[m], I headed back up the hill. More light was coming over the cliffs now, and I could feel the presence of the climb back up Heddon’s Mouth Cleave looming ahead of me. Strava has it a > 40% gradient and that doesn’t seem too far wrong.
As the trail kicked up for the final time, I had nothing left to kick back with. I was walking briskly, but still moving. Wondering if my legs[n] would come back to life when the trail gave me a chance. The dilemma of <object value =”running clothes” id = “8” type=”perm”>running clothing</object> meant that I would be pretty cold if they didn’t. Of course they did, and the final miles were just a job of closing out.
I don’t think this run will go down as an epic adventure. But, it was a chance to taste uncertainty. It was another beautiful bit of Devon. And maybe this is where more adventures may lie. Cheap, local, directly connected with the ground.
